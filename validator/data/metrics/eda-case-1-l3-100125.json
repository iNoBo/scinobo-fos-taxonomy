The aim of the present study was to assess whether the method of dehydration would affect subsequent post exercise rehydration. \n \nTwelve recreationally active male subjects either remained euhydrated (EU), or reduced their body mass by 2.0% by 24 h fluid restriction (FR), or a combination of intermittent exercise in the heat (34 \u00b0C, 60% rh) followed by 13 h fluid restriction (FREX). 30 min post performance of a maximal exercise capacity test, they ingested 2428 (sd 561) ml (equivalent to 150% of their total body mass loss( 3 )) of a carbohydrate electrolyte drink (6% carbohydrate and 21 mM [Na+]) over a 60 min period. Blood and urine samples were collected prior to dehydration, pre and post exercise capacity test and every hour during the 60 min rehydration and 4 h recovery phase.

Method: A retrospective clinical audit of 15 patients with delayed or hypertrophic non-unions treated successfully with closed distraction in circular external fixation.

Inclusion criteria: all patients with delayed or hypertrophic non-union, treated by closed distraction between 2004 and 2011. Results: Fifteen patients included in the study. The average time to union was 188 days. The most common complication was local pin tract sepsis. The most serious complication was a broken fixation ring that needed replacement. Conclusion: Biomechanical fracture strain is calculated by dividing the fracture gap distance by the change in the fracture distance i.e. FRACTURE STRAIN = DIFFERENCE IN L/L Hypertrophic non-union occurs when the fracture strain is more than 10 %. This formula shows that by increasing the fracture gap, the fracture strain will decrease This concept is contrary to the current practice of compressing the fracture. This study shows that distraction can be used to manipulate the biomechanical circumstances that dictate the development of fracture non-union. Furthermore ring fixators are ideal devices to use for biomechanical manipulation.", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery-british Volume", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "A geographical analysis of beach sports and activities through the lens of ongoing transformations and trends.

To measure the geometry and morphology of these knees is to know whether a single unicondylar knee implant design is suitable for all patients, i.e. for patients with varus deformity and those without. The aim of this study was to identify any significant differences between normal and varus knees that may influence unicondylar implant design for the latter group. Methodology: 56 patients (31 varus, 25 normal) were evaluated through CT imaging. Images were segmented to create 3D models and aligned to a tri-spherical plane (centres of spheres fitted to the femoral head and the medial and lateral flexion facets). 30 key co-ordinates were recorded per specimen to define the important axes, angles and shapes (e.g. spheres to define flexion and extension facet surfaces) that describe the femoral condylar geometry using in-house software. The points were then projected in sagittal, coronal and transverse planes. Standardised distance and angular measurements were then carried out between the points and the differences between the morphology of normal and varus knee summarised. For the varus knee group, trends were investigated that could be related to the magnitude of varus deformity. Results: Several significant differences between normal and varus knees were found, but most of these were small differences unlikely to be clinically significant or have an influence on implant design. However, two strong trends were observed. Firstly, the version of the femoral neck was significantly less for patients with varus knees (mean difference 9\u00b0; p The second trend was a significant difference in the sagittal morphology of the medial condyle. The kink angle, the angle formed by the intersection of the circles fitted to the flexion and extension facet surfaces, and their centres (Figure 1) was either absent or small in normal knees (mean 1\u00b0). An absent kink angle occurs when the circle defining the flexion facet surface lies within or makes a tangent to the circle defining the extension facet. However, for varus knees, the mean kink angle was 9\u00b0, with positive correlation with the angle of varus deformity (Figure 2). Discussion: Varus knees have a significantly larger kink angle than normal knees, influencing the relative positions of the flexion and extension facet spheres that define the medial condylar geometry, contributing to the commonly observed \u2018flattening\u2019 of the medial condyle in the sagittal plane. Varus knees are also associated with significantly less anteversion of the femoral neck. It has been shown that reduced femoral neck anteversion causes increased loading of the medial condyle [1], and our results support this finding. The data generated in this study will feed further biomechanical testing to investigate the influence of kink angle and femoral neck version on the kinematics and load distribution in the varus knee.", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery-british Volume", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Concurrent Resistance and Endurance Training in Healthy Older Adults: A Review of Current Literature: 1823", "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate current concurrent resistance and endurance training literature as a potential method for physical activity promotion in healthy older adults.

Results: Of the 23 articles surveyed, the majority of them support concurrent resistance and endurance exercise as a method to improve fitness as well as decreasing resting heart rate and blood pressure, decreasing fall risk, increasing mobility, and increasing strength. The major negative seen throughout the literature was that the level of physiological responses normally seen in separate resistance and endurance exercise programs was decreased when concurrent resistance and endurance training was employed.

However, little is known about how ATs perceive SDH or how knowledgeable they are about social factors that contribute to patient health and well-being.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate ATs' familiarity and comfort with SDH and their perceived knowledge and recognition of SDH.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional.\n\n\nSETTING\nOnline survey.\n\n\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS\nOur survey was distributed to 17 000 ATs; 1829 accessed it (access rate=10.8%), and 1694 completed it (completion rate=92.6%, AT experience=15.2\u00b110.6 years, age=36.6\u00b110.8 years).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe survey included multipart questions that evaluated ATs' perceptions of their familiarity, comfort, and knowledge about SDH. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFew respondents (4.1%, 70/1691) reported they were extremely familiar with SDH. Most reported being moderately familiar (45.0%, 761/1691), minimally familiar (34.7%, 587/1691), or not familiar at all (16.1%, 273/1691). For questions about comfort, few reported being extremely comfortable (3.5%, 59/1691) with SDH, and most reported being moderately comfortable (35.4%, 598/1691), minimally comfortable (41.1%, 695/1691), or not comfortable at all (18.6%, 314/1691). For questions about knowledge, few reported being extremely knowledgeable (2.7%, 46/1686) about SDH, and the majority reported being moderately (38.9%, 622/1686), minimally (41.8%, 704/1686) or not knowledgeable at all (18.6%, 314/1686). Over half of ATs accurately categorized 8 of the 9 SDH listed in the survey, and 22% endorsed more correct than incorrect items.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA majority of ATs perceived their familiarity, comfort, and knowledge about SDH to be moderate-to-low, which may reflect the relatively recent emphasis on SDH in athletic healthcare. Because SDH can have a major impact on patient health and well-being, strategies should be developed for educating ATs about SDH. Developing strategies to increase comfort with the SDH in patient care is critical to ensure that those factors that can be addressed at the patient level are identified and managed.", "doi": "10.4085/1062-6050-0337.22", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of athletic training", "venue": "Journal of athletic training", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Prolonged Exercise-induced Oxidative Damage in Lungs was Attenuated in iPS Cells Injected Rats: 3078", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1249/01.MSS.0000402470.09644.70", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "La relation de domination Han sur le peuple tib\u00e9tain\u00a0: l\u2019exemple du biopic sportif chinois 40\u00a0000 Kilometers de Keke (2017)", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.3917/sta.pr1.0067", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Staps", "venue": "Staps", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Effect of an Acute Bout of Eccentric Exercise at Different Velocities on Muscle Hypertrophy Signaling: 1490", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1249/01.MSS.0000384413.20968.2A", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}], "rehabilitation": [{"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Effect of the sensory integration therapy for children with developmental disorders - Using the assessment of communication and interaction skills (ACIS)", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/J.REHAB.2018.05.697", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine", "venue": "Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Acquired brain injury", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1891/9780826131379", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Development and Psychometric Testing of the Bimanual Assessment Measure for People With Chronic Stroke.", "abstract": "IMPORTANCE\nFew tools are available to assess bimanual deficits after stroke.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo develop the Bimanual Assessment Measure (BAM), which assesses a person's hand coordination in both preferred and prestroke roles (i.e., stabilizer or manipulator).\n\n\nDESIGN\nDevelopment and psychometric testing of the BAM.\n\n\nSETTING\nResearch laboratory.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nPeople with chronic stroke (n = 24), age-matched controls (n = 23), and occupational therapists (n = 40).\n\n\nOUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nWe assessed the BAM's internal consistency, reliability, and face and known-groups validity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nItems were selected as meaningful tasks that represented a range of bimanual coordination requirements (e.g., symmetrical forces and timing, asymmetrical forces and timing, time-limited reactive movement).

In some types of dislocations, Rockwood type III in particular, the indication for surgical treatment as such is relative. There are numerous techniques and implants available for the reconstruction of AC joint. In our research we focused on the necessity of coracoclavicular (CC) joint reconstruction. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this paper, a cohort of 56 patients with Rockwood type III AC joint injury who underwent surgical treatment at our department in 2010-2016 period was retrospectively evaluated. The patients were treated with open reduction with AC joint stabilisation using hook plate or tension band. The patients were divided into 2 groups, namely group 1 with CC ligament reconstruction and group 2 without CC ligament reconstruction. The assessment was done at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after surgery. The clinical outcomes were assessed based on the absolute Constant score (CS) and coracoclavicular distance (CCD) on the X-ray. Subsequently, the outcomes were statistically processed and compared using the Student s ttest. RESULTS The least invasive surgical intervention, as to the length of incision, was the reconstruction using the hook plate without CC ligament suture, whereas the longest incision was performed in tension band with CC ligament suture. In the CC ligament suture group, the mean operative time was 10 minutes longer. When evaluating the CS of the compared groups with and without CC ligament reconstruction, no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) was found between the two groups. Similarly, the CCD values at 2-year follow-up did not show any statistically significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The available outcomes suggest that the surgical methods used by us are adequately safe and reliable. Good clinical outcomes can be achieved by open reduction and fixation of Rockwood type III AC joint dislocation even without CC ligament reconstruction.

Selected surgical procedures can effectively restore active extension of the wrist and provide conditions for some vital pinching and gripping abilities. The deltoid muscle also has a potential for restoration of upper limb function, because its posterior portion can be used to restore elbow extension. The aim of this clinical retrospective study was to describe and evaluate the techniques used to improve the quality of life in patients with spinal chord lesions at the C5 level.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe group studied consisted of 15 patients (3 women and 12 men; average age, 34 years) with a spinal chord lesion at the C5 segment who had zero wrist extension or in whom wrist extensor muscle force was equal to the third degree of muscle strength or less. The procedures to restore active extension of the wrist involved the radiobrachialis muscle, the reconstruction of elbow extension was activated by the posterior portion of the deltoid muscle, and a fixed supination posture of the forearm was corrected by elongating the distal tendon of the biceps muscle which was derotated and attached to the proximal radius. The interval between injury and reconstructive surgery was 36 months on the average.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe reconstructive surgery described resulted in restoration of hand and wrist function with sufficient muscle strength in all patients, which had a favourable effect on many aspects of their daily lives. The average values of muscle strength were 4.1\u00b0 (3\u00b0 to 5\u00b0). for wrist extension and 3.3\u00b0 (2\u00b0 to 4\u00b0) for elbow extension. Key-pinch force was on average 1.2 kg (0.2 to 2.1). A failure of thumb carpometacarpal arthrodesis was the most frequent complication and occurred in two patients. On clinical evaluation, all patients reported satisfaction with the restored function of their upper extremities and expressed their willingness to undergo the same procedure again.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nReconstructive surgery of the upper extremity in tetraplegic patients has been performed with success in several countries, namely USA and Sweden, for many years. Since 2003 the results in the Czech Republic have also shown positive effects of reconstructive procedures on better quality of life in patients with cervical spinal chord injury at the lower levels, in whom the goal is to restore vital pinching and gripping abilities. A good outcome of surgical treatment requires good quality post-operative care provided by a team of physical therapists fully informed of the reconstructive procedures involved.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA restored function of the upper extremity in the patients with spinal chord injury at the C level plays a decisive role in the whole spectrum of the patient's daily activities, such as dressing, communication, etc., and thus improves their self- care. The restoration of active elbow extension has a positive effect on the patient's mobility.", "doi": "10.55095/achot2010/082", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca", "venue": "Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "JAAOS Serving the Orthopaedic Community Even Better.", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.5435/JAAOS-D-18-00809", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons", "venue": "Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Clinical Issues\u2014February 2010", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/J.AORN.2009.11.059", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "AORN Journal", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Therapeutic Effects of Small Incision Open Reduction and Internal Fixation and Arthroscopic High Strength Non-Absorbable Suture on Tibial Insertion Avulsion Fracture of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament.", "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To evaluate the therapeutic effects of small incision open reduction and internal fixation and arthroscopic high strength non-absorbable suture on tibial insertion avulsion fracture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). MATERIAL AND METHODS In this prospectively study, 72 patients with ACL tibial insertion avulsion fracture treated from December 2017 to June 2020 were enrolled and divided into group A (treated with small incision open reduction and cannulated screw internal fixation) and group B (treated with arthroscopic high strength non-absorbable suture) using a random number table (n=36). Their general data, surgical indices and incidence of postoperative adverse reactions were compared. Knee function indices were compared before and after treatment, and evaluated by random walk model. RESULTS No significant differences were found in the general data, intraoperative blood loss, preoperative Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Tegner score, knee range of motion and difference of bilateral tibial forward displacement distance, and total incidence rate of postoperative adverse reactions between the two groups (P>0.05). Group B had significantly longer operation time, and significantly shorter hospital stay, time of first ambulation after operation and bone healing time than group A (P<0.05). Both groups had improved Lysholm score, IKDC score, Tegner score and knee range of motion after treatment, especially in group B (P<0.05). The difference of bilateral tibial forward displacement distance significantly reduced in both groups after treatment, particularly in group B (P<0.05). The random walk model revealed that group B had better improvement of knee function than group A. CONCLUSIONS Arthroscopic high strength non-absorbable suture in the treatment of ACL tibial insertion avulsion fracture can dramatically improve the knee function indices of patients, with rapid recovery and high safety, so it has a broad prospect of clinical application.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective cohort of 219 patients (136 females, 83 males) undergoing staged total knee arthroplasty for the treatment of advanced bilateral gonarthrosis were followed for up to 12 months. The mean was 69.51\u00b15.02 (56-80) years. Patients were categorized into five groups based on the time between the first and second operations; Group I (21-90 days), Group II (91-180 days), Group III (181-270 days), Group IV (271-360 days), and Group V (more than 360 days). Patients were evaluated based on time from surgery and were assigned to corresponding groups. The data recorded included age, body mass index (BMI), side of operated knee, complications, and radiological and clinical findings. Visual analog scale (VAS) for non-operated knees was applied. Activities of Daily Living Score (ADLS) was applied to the patients at last follow-up. RESULTS No statistically significant difference was noted in BMI values (p=0.634), range of joint motion (RJM) (p=0.940) and age (p=0.785) distribution between the five groups. In Group I, the mean VAS score increased by 7.83 to 7.98, 7.86 to 8.53 in Group II, by 7.85 to 8.54 in Group III, 7.85 to 8.59 in Group IV, and 7.88 to 8.64 in Group V. There was no statistically significant difference in preoperative ADLS between the groups (p=0.064), but there was a statistically significant difference in postoperative ADLS (p=0.001). Group I patients had significantly lower postoperative ADLS compared to the other groups (p=0.001). The mean increase in postoperative ADLS versus preoperative scores of all groups were statistically significant The most significant improvements occurred in Groups II and III. Similarly, preexisting pain in the non-operated knee started to increase in Group II and continued in all groups. DISCUSSION Given all these findings, we believe that it is reasonable to advise patients to receive their second TKA, 3-6 months after their initial TKA, as this interval will allow for the greatest improvements in functional and daily living activities, and pain in the non-operated knee simultaneously becomes more severe. This recommended interval would minimize both the functional problems with the operated extremity due to pain, and deformity and dysfunction in the non-operated knee and the subsequent overloading. CONCLUSIONS Even though a number of factors influence the optimal interval for staged TKAs in bilateral gonarthrosis, an interval of 91-270 days appears to be the optimal interval between surgeries in terms of minimizing pain and maximizing ADL s and knee scores.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank Michael Balls for all of his hard work and dedication to the journal for over 30 years. This demonstrates his true commitment, and I can state from the outset my tenure will not match his record! I would like to thank Susan Trigwell and Rita Seabra for their work in ensuring the continuity and quality of the journal. I also appreciate the effort of both current and former associate editors, editorial board members, contributors and SAGE Publishing in supporting and promoting the journal. I look forward to working with all of you as the journal evolves in this new chapter. For more information on forthcoming plans for the journal, please refer to the Comment article in this issue: A Journey to Replacement and the Inevitable Question. This includes a personal perspective on animal use and opportunities for the future. Whilst full replacement of the use of animals in experiments is recognised as a long-term goal, currently advances in medical science still require the use of animals, or animal-derived material. Where such experiments are necessary, optimisation of animal welfare (both during and after the procedures), is an obligatory consideration \u2014 as is ensuring that maximum information is derived from the experiments undertaken, and that they are the most appropriate experiments for answering the particular question posed. In this issue, these topics are examined from three complementary perspectives: (i) the appropriate use and interpretation of animal models; (ii) replacing the use of animal-derived material, where possible; and (iii) ensuring the welfare of animals postexperimentation. My own background is in developing and evaluating in silico models. The question as to what can be considered to be a \u2018valid\u2019 in silico model has often been raised. All models are surrogates for the system of interest, and with correct interpretation they can provide relevant information. However, caution needs to be exercised to ensure that the model is appropriately applied and results correctly interpreted, without extrapolating beyond the bounds of the model. Although a model may not have been formally \u2018validated\u2019, it can still yield important information \u2014 providing that its suitability for a given purpose has been established. Herein, Stanford provides an in-depth discussion of the use and misuse of animalbased \u2018models\u2019 for psychiatric disorders, as well as the limitations of translation of preclinical studies based on these models to humans, in what is clearly one of the most challenging areas of medicine in which to develop models. King et al. describe a proof-of-concept study, in which modified human erythrocytes were shown to be a suitable alternative to animal-derived erythrocytes for the evaluation of complement activity, under optimised pretreatment conditions. The overall method, being a partial replacement of the use of animal-derived material, demonstrates the incremental progression towards replacing the use of animals. Finally, H\u00e4nninen and Norring report the results of a project to investigate issues surrounding the re-homing of Beagles (as opposed to euthanasia) at the end of their use in experiments. The benefits, not only for the dogs but also for their caretakers, are described and recommendations given with regard to advanced planning for eventual re-homing, in order to improve successful outcomes. This issue of ATLA aptly exemplifies the breadth of topics concerning experimental animal use: from the development of animal alternatives, through the correct use and interpretation of the current animal models, to the ultimate re-homing of the animals used.

Advancements in genetic alteration and analytical techniques have enabled rapid development of disease models using preclinical animals and cell cultures. However, success rates of drug development remain low due to limited recapitulation of clinical pathophysiology by these models. To resolve this challenge, the pharmaceutical industry has explored microphysiological system (MPS) disease models, which are complex in vitro systems that include but are not limited to organ-on-a-chip, organoids, spheroids, and 3D bioengineered tissues (e.g., 3D printing, hydrogels). Capable of integrating key in vivo properties, such as disease-relevant human cells, multi-cellularity/dimensionality of organs, and/or well-controlled physical and molecular cues, MPS disease models are being developed for a variety of indications. With on-going qualifications or validations for wide adoption within the pharmaceutical industry, MPS disease models hold exciting potential to enable in-depth investigation of in vivo pathophysiology and enhance drug discovery and development processes. To introduce the present status of MPS disease models, this paper describes notable examples in six disease areas: cancer, liver/kidney diseases, respiratory diseases/COVID-19, neurodegenerative diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and select rare diseases.

METHODS Over a 10-year period, 50 patients were referred for PCN of 60 kidneys with a nondilated renal collecting system. The patients included 22 males and 28 females with a mean age of 63.2 years (range: 35-87 years). The most common reason for PCN in these patients was postoperative ure- teral leaks and/or fistula (21/50 patients). PCN was performed under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance. During PCN, intravenous contrast media or diuretics were not used. Technical success rate, complications, procedure time, and radiation exposure of the procedure were retrospec- tively evaluated. RESULTS Ultrasound- and fluoroscopy-guided PCN for nondilated renal collecting system showed a suc- cess rate of 83.3% (50/60 kidneys) in the initial attempt. Four PCNs were repeated and were suc- cessful after the initial PCN failure. There was 1 major complication of bleeding that required transfusion in 1.9% (1/54) PCNs and there were minor complications of transient gross hematuria through the PCN catheter in 31.5% (17/54) PCNs. Mean duration of the procedure was 15.97 \u00b1 7.81 min and median fluoroscopy time was 4.2 min (range: 1.2-15.3 min).

Methods: A 2018 search of state government websites identified entities involved in enrolling and credentialing dentists. States were classified according to their administrative approach. Results: Twenty-two states administered their dental programs internally, 24 through contracted Medicaid managed care organizations (MMCOs), and five through a combined approach. Thirteen of 22 (59 percent) internally-administered and eight of 24 (33 percent) MMCO-administered states carved out their dental programs to a dental managed care organization. Twenty-one of 22 (95 percent) state-administered but only nine of 24 (38 percent) MMCO-administered programs provided complete enrollment instructions. To serve the entire pediatric Medicaid population in a given state, dentists needed to enroll and be credentialed by one to eight entities. Providers needed to complete an average of one application and one contract in carved-out and internally administered states, three applications and two contracts in dental MCO carved-out states, and five applications and four contracts in MMCO states.

Channels were only brushed once and 7 of 30 audited scopes had measurable bioburden. Consistent with VA policy, a retrospective investigation, along with public disclosure, was performed. Methods: A potentially exposed case (PEC) was defined as any patient who had flexible fiberoptic endoscopy between April 19, 2015, and June 23, 2017, when the identified SPS technician worked in the endoscope reprocessing station. Using the internal log of the automated high\u2013level disinfection equipment (Medivators/Cantel, Minneapolis, MN), device serial numbers were matched to patients in endoscopy suite procedure logs. Additionally, the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) was queried for CPT and International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and ICD-10 procedure codes to verify identified cases and to search for other PECs. All PECs were notified by telephone and mail, and serologic testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) was offered. Results were compared to prior bloodborne pathogen (BBP) testing results extracted from the CDW. Facility microbiology laboratory records of positive cultures/microscopy for enteric pathogens also were compared to the list of PECs; no active testing was performed. Results: Of the 565 PECs, 552 (98%) were successfully contacted. 8 declined testing or preferred non-VA testing, and 22 died before testing could be initiated. Repeat testing at 6 months was requested for PECs who had initial testing performed <6 months after exposure; 32 refused additional tests or did not respond to additional requests. In total, 522 PECs (92%) had testing performed for 1 or more BBPs: (1) 521 were anti\u2013HIV negative with 1 previously known positive; (2) 481 were anti\u2013HCV negative\u201443 were previously known positive and 1 PEC with an undetectable HCV viral load was newly identified; (3) 461 were negative for both HBV core or surface antibodies and surface antigen\u201432 were previously known positive and 17 were newly positive for one or both antibody tests with negative HBV surface antigen. Of 17 newly identified positive PECs, 16 had undetectable HBV DNA; 1 died prior to HBV DNA testing. Conclusions: There was no evidence of transmission of BBPs in this cohort of PECs who had procedures with potentially improperly cleaned fiberoptic endoscopes. Although not all patients completed all retrospective BBP testing, <10% were missing all or some tests. Local passive surveillance did not indicate enteric pathogen transmission.

Despite having HAI rates 3 times higher than high-income countries, many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) lack trained IPC professionals. During the 2014\u20132016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) recognized this need and appointed and trained IPC focal persons at all district hospitals. Following the outbreak, MoHS requested assistance from the US CDC to develop and implement a comprehensive IPC training program for IPC specialists. Methods: The CDC, alongside its partners, convened a multidisciplinary team to develop an IPC certificate course. ICAP led the curriculum development process using a \u201cbackwards design\u201d approach, starting with development of competencies and learning objectives, then designing an evaluation framework and learning strategies, and finally, identifying course content. The curriculum was based on existing resources, primarily designed for high-income countries, which were adapted to the Sierra Leone context and aligned with national IPC policies and guidelines. Additionally, an IPC steering committee, led by MoHS, was established to provide national leadership and oversight and make country-level decisions regarding accreditation and career pathways for IPC specialists. Results: The course includes three 2-week workshops over 6 months consisting of classroom didactics and hands-on activities. Topics include standard and transmission-based precautions, microbiology, laboratory, HAI, quality improvement, leadership, and scientific writing. Between sessions, participants conduct IPC activities at their work site and share results during subsequent workshops. Participants receive electronic tablets, which contain course content, assessment tools, and references, to upload their work into a cloud-based storage system for facilitators to provide feedback. They also receive in-person mentorship and connect with peers through a group messaging platform to share lessons learned. Participants\u2019 knowledge and skills are assessed using a before-and-after test and observing them perform IPC practices using standardized checklists. The first cohort of 25 participants will complete the course in November 2019. Conclusions: The IPC certificate course is the first comprehensive, competency-based IPC training in Sierra Leone. Successes, challenges, sustainability, and lessons learned remain to be determined; however, based on similar models, the course has the potential to significantly improve IPC in Sierra Leone. Additionally, it is a model that can be replicated in other resource-limited settings.

With the raise of environmental protection awareness, applying models to control NPS (non-point source) pollution has become a key approach for environmental protection and pollution prevention and control in China. In this study, we implanted the semi-conceptual model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) using information on rainfall runoff, land use, soil and slope. The model was used to quantify the spatial loading of NPS nutrient total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) to the Huntai River Watershed (HTRW) under two scenarios: without and with projected buffer zones of approximately 1\u2009km within both banks of the Huntai, Taizi and Daliao river trunk streams and 5\u2009km around the reservoirs. Current land-use types within the buffer zone were varied to indicate the natural ecology and environment. The Nash\u2013Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (ENS) and R2 for flow and predicted nutrient concentrations (TN and TP) in a typical hydrological station were both greater than 0.6, and the relative deviation (|Dv|) was less than 20\u2009%. Under the status quo scenario (SQS), the simulated soil erosion in the HTRW per year was 811\u2009kg/ha, and the output loadings of TN and TP were 19 and 7\u2009kg/ha, respectively. The maximum loadings for TN and TP were 365 and 260\u2009kg/ha, respectively. Under environmental protection scenarios (EPS), the TN and TP pollutant loadings per unit area were reduced by 26\u2009% and 14\u2009% annually, respectively. Loading analysis showed that land-use type is a key factor controlling NPS pollution. The NPS pollutant loading decreased under the simulated EPS, indicating that environmental protection measures may reduce the NPS pollutant loading in HTRW. The 22\u2009% pollutant reduction under the EPS. We finally quantified the ratio of the land area lost to agricultural production compared with that lost to ecosystem services. We calculated the agricultural yield elasticity and concluded that the corresponding crop yield would be reduced by 2\u2009% when the land area for ecosystem services in the basin increased by 1\u2009% under the EPS.\n", "doi": "10.5194/HESS-2018-339", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Analysis of human-water harmony and the sustainable development of water environment", "abstract": "The problems of water environment of China include: the coexistence of water shortage,waste and pollution phenomenon;ecological degradation and frequent floods;water management system are not perfect and water environment construction lack of system planning;industrial structure and layout does not adapted to water resources condition.Facing these problems,human began to know the relationship between human and water,emphasize human-water harmony and the sustainable development of water environment.Following countermeasures are suggested: enhance citizens' consciousness of water,creating water-saving society;optimize the industrial structure and layout,realize the optimal allocation of water resources;sewage disposal entrepreneurial;increase scientific and technological investment,vigorously develop and utilize non-regular water resources;realizing unified management of water resources,strengthen the legislative and planning of water resources;play the role of economic levers price,and promote the sustainable use of urban water resources.", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Ground Water", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Power Allocation for NOMA with CSI Uncertainties and Imperfect Successive Interference Cancellation", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": "International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Predicted pH of groundwater in the Mississippi River Valley alluvial and Claiborne aquifers, south-central United States", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.3133/sim3465", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Scientific Investigations Map", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "EPA's Unprecedented Interim Drinking Water Health Advisories for PFOA and PFOS", "abstract": "Per\u2010 and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent and widely distributed in the environment from commercial products and waste process residues, including in surface waters usually at low parts per trillion (ppt) levels.

The particulate nature of diamonds, their size distribution in the deposit, shape, quality, and colour also impact on the estimation and classification of diamond resources.

Sampling to define grade variability on a local scale is often problematic as diamond deposits generally have very low grades (in terms of parts per million or ppm) when compared to other mineral deposits, as illustrated in Figure 1. These factors make the accurate estimation of diamond resources challenging and dictate that a significant quantity of optimized sampling is required to minimize risk. It follows that an accurate view of the level of uncertainty in the Mineral Resource estimate is critical in terms of obtaining a representative Mineral Resource classification for diamond deposits. The classification plays a critical role in terms of the status of a diamond deposit in the project delivery pipeline and the associated investment decisions.

In the project, which is still ongoing, a series of novelists was commissioned to retell a Shakespeare play in prose form. The series began with the publication of Jeanette Winterson\u2019s version of The Winter\u2019s Tale , The Gap of Time , in 2015, and it will be concluded with the publication of Gillian Flynn\u2019s retelling of Hamlet . Three novels were published in 2016: Howard Jacobson\u2019s Shylock is My Name (a retelling of The Merchant of Venice ), Anne Tyler\u2019s Vinegar Girl ( The Taming of the Shrew ) and Margaret Atwood\u2019s Hag-Seed ( The Tempest ); in 2017 Tracy Chevalier\u2019s New Boy ( Othello ) and Edward St. Aubyn\u2019s Dunbar ( King Lear ) were released, and Jo Nesb\u00f8\u2019s Macbeth was published in 2018. Continuing \u201ca lengthy history of Shakespearean reconceptualisations\u201d, the project also contributes to the current tendency of \u201cupdating Shakespeare\u2019s works and substituting a modern idiom for Shakespeare\u2019s\u201d (Cavanagh 99; Lanier 230). 2 The commissioned authors and the popular conceptions of their work as representative of a certain form of writing play a particularly important role in the process of establishing a new generic framework for the modern reworkings of Shakespeare\u2019s plays: the adaptation process involves not only a recontextualisation of the material from the genre of drama to that of prose, but the choice of author to adapt it may also serve adaptation in very specific subgenre, or microgenre, defined by the and The novels commissioned and published as part of the Hogarth Shakespeare project involve a series of recontextualisations of Shakespeare\u2019s work, not only from the genre of drama to that of prose or a range of established subgenres, but the choice of author to adapt it may also serve to locate the adaptation in a very specific microgenre defined by the connotations engendered by the modern author\u2019s oeuvre \u2013 and frame its reception accordingly. The article discusses how this process finds expression in the Hogarth Shakespeare project paratexts, which are seen as ways of making creative use of the popular conceptions of the modern authors evoked by their very names to reframe, revise and re-energise Shakespeare\u2019s work for new audiences, in part through the specific form of (micro)generic recontextualisation that they bring about. centrale dans ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 : l\u2019apparition du nom de Jo Nesb\u00f8 sur la couverture de Macbeth , les arguments des critiques de Edward St. Aubyn qui relatent \u00e0 nouveau l\u2019histoire du Roi Lear , ou l\u2019utilisation de Gillian Flynn pour adapter Hamlet sont des fa\u00e7ons d\u2019exploiter de mani\u00e8re cr\u00e9ative les conceptions populaires des auteurs modernes \u00e9voqu\u00e9s par leurs appellations pour red\u00e9finir, r\u00e9viser et redynamiser les travaux de Shakespeare pour un nouveau public, en partie par la forme sp\u00e9cifique de recontextualisation g\u00e9n\u00e9rique qu\u2019elles apportent.", "doi": "10.4000/interfaces.5053", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Interfaces", "venue": "Interfaces", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Front & Back Matter", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1159/000491055", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism", "venue": "Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Cushing\u2019s syndrome and diseases of cardiovascular system", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Editorial Board and Contents", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/S1043-2760(19)30015-3", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Trends in Endocrinology & Metabolism", "venue": "Trends in endocrinology and metabolism", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Diabetic retinopathy screening for specialist care.", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi", "venue": "Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Technology and Pregnancy.", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1089/dia.2021.2507", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Diabetes technology & therapeutics", "venue": "Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Multiple drugs", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1007/s40278-019-65664-9", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Reactions Weekly", "venue": "Reactions weekly", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}], "complementary & alternative medicine": [{"title": "A Discovery of Resonance Frequencies on Twelve Meridians of Human Body by Bioimpedance Spectroscopy Method", "abstract": "Objective: The resonance frequency (Fr) of twelve meridians was observed by means of sweep frequency of weak constant current, and a method of evaluating Fr was explored.

Walsh Harvard Medical School Reflections on Chemical Biology A lthough we still consider ACS Chemical Biology as being a young journal, we do already have our traditions and rituals. One of these is to invite, once per year, scientists from various areas of chemical biology to reflect on progresses achieved and to define the challenges that lie ahead. While we try to group these reviews around a common theme, the diversity of chemical biology as a discipline and the divergent opinions and preferences of our editorial board help us avoid the compilation of a thematically narrow special issue (vide infra). The main focus of this year\u2019s special issue is the use of small molecules as probes to interrogate signaling pathways and the identification of the target proteins of such probes. Virtually all biological processes are controlled by protein phosphorylation and protein kinases, a research topic that has consequently attracted numerous chemical biologists. Through this work it has become apparent that a variety of complementary tools are needed so that we can unravel all the mysterious mechanisms of how kinases control signaling networks. In this issue, Carlson and White provide an overview of how recent developments in chemical phosphoproteomic and chemical genetic methods permit us to gain new insights into network structures and the system-wide effects of kinase inhibitors. The authors predict that such approaches will lead to a much more detailed understanding of signaling networks regulation and how these networks respond to targeted perturbations, which should ultimately also lead to more efficacious therapeutic strategies. Small molecule probes are often generated through screening for molecules that either directly target defined biochemical activities (proteins) or induce complex phenotypes. Ulrike Eggert now argues in her review that there is plenty of room in the middle: The screening for pathway-directed probes should bridge and complement approaches that either target individual proteins or complex phenotypes. Her review not only demonstrates how such molecules can be identified but also outlines the enormous promises they hold. Small molecules generally exert their activity by binding to individual proteins, and the identification of all protein targets of a given bioactive molecule or drug is one of the key challenges in chemical biology. Two articles in this issue describe complementary approaches to address this problem. Jing Huang and colleagues review methods for the direct identification of drug\u2013protein interactions. At the center of their review is a recently introduced approach (dubbed DARTS) that exploits the phenomenon that the binding of small molecules to proteins often increases their resistance toward proteases. The key feature of this approach is that it does not require a derivatization of the molecule of interest. Palchaudhuri and Hergenrother describe how transcription profiling and RNA interference can be used to define the mechanism of action of a small molecule and to identify new therapeutic use. As with DARTS, these approaches do not require a modification of the small molecule of interest and have the additional advantage that they are compatible with membrane proteins. The Palchaudhuri and Hergenrother review is complemented by a careful analysis by Sigoillot and King of how RNA interference screenings can be compromised by the occurrence of unintended off-target effects. The authors consider the potential causes of off-target effects and why this phenomenon can produce high hit rates in siRNA screens. The review is a reminder also that results obtained with Nobel-prize-winning technologies require independent validation before new biological insights can be gained.", "doi": "10.1021/cb100405m", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "ACS chemical biology", "venue": "ACS Chemical Biology", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Educating Leaders 2019: Abstracts From AACOM's Annual Conference.", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.7556/jaoa.2020.035", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association", "venue": "The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Effect of Electroacupuncture on Transcutaneous Oxygen Partial Pressure During Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Healthy Individuals.", "abstract": "CONTEXT\nThe goal of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is to increase the oxygen (O\u2082) supply to the body significantly. Because of the toxic side effects and complications of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO\u2082), the environmental pressure and treatment time must be restricted. The research team hypothesized that other therapies administered during HBOT could safely improve the value of the arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO\u2082) during HBOT and improve its therapeutic effect.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe study intended to investigate whether electroacupuncture (EA) while receiving HBOT had a greater effect for healthy individuals than HBOT or EA alone or EA combined with normobaric pure oxygen (pure O\u2082).\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe research team designed a randomized, controlled trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nThe study was performed in the Department of Hyperbaric Medicine at the No. 401 Hospital of the People's Liberation Army in Qingdao, China.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 81 volunteers were recruited.

Our aim was to investigate whether obese women and their infants have higher rates of health care utilization in the first year postpartum. Methods We extracted EMR data of 1663 women who had singleton, live births in 2006\u20132009, height and weight measurements for BMI, known delivery and discharge dates, and continuous health insurance coverage for 12 months post-partum. We used multivariate regression analyses to evaluate associations between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI category and maternal and infant outpatient visits and hospitalizations. Results During the first year post-partum, women made an average of 7.0 + 7.3 ambulatory visits, including a wide variety of ancillary services as well as primary and specialty care. Thirty percent (492/1663) were hospitalized at least once, 19% (311/1663) had at least one emergency department visit and 25% (421/1663) visited urgent care. When adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, insurance status and delivery type, women with BMIs > 30 had significantly more ambulatory, urgent care and emergency visits. Women with BMIs > 40 had significantly more hospitalizations and outpatient visits of all types compared to women with normal BMIs. There were 1427 infants with adequate data for inclusion. During the first year of life, 21% (299 of 1427) were hospitalized, 32% (454/1427) had at least one emergency visit, and 47% (676/1427) visited urgent care. Essentially all infants (99.7%) had an ambulatory visit. Maternal BMI was not significantly associated with infant hospitalization, emergency or urgent care visits. However, infants whose mothers had BMIs >30 had significantly fewer ambulatory visits compared to infants of mothers with normal BMIs (p=.008). Discussion During the first year post-partum, obese women had more ambulatory care and emergency visits than normal weight women, the greatest differences occurring between extreme obesity and normal BMI categories.

High PSE may have different consequences for infant development depending on the basis of PSE (e.g., actual experience vs. persuasion). High PSE may also not be maintained when actual parenting starts. Experimental studies, intervention studies, and longitudinal studies starting during pregnancy are yielding novel findings on PSE, which serve as input for a discussion that should deepen understanding of PSE and increase the utility of the concept for practice. The first presentation tests robustness of PSE in two ways. The first approach is based on a computerized task in which prenatal PSE was challenged among 179 pregnant women by manipulating success in regulating the baby. The second approach followed first-time mothers (intended N=1000) across all trimesters of pregnancy and during the first year to examine patterns of change in PSE in relation to infant temperament. Analyses of the experimental data demonstrated that PSE decreased in response to regulation difficulty. The longitudinal data (preliminary n = 138) indicated that PSE on average increased across pregnancy and first year, but not for mothers of more irritable babies. Is there a common mechanism involved? The second presentation focuses on the course of PSE from pregnancy to 9 months postpartum in 180 new mothers and fathers, and the role that coparenting support plays in initial levels of PSE and change in PSE over time. Expectant parents completed a survey regarding task-specific PSE during the third trimester of pregnancy, and again 3 months and 9 months after their infant\u2019s birth. At 3 months and 9 months postpartum, new parents completed a survey about coparenting. Preliminary SEM analyses of associations between PSE and coparenting support over time indicate that for fathers, increases in PSE from 3 to 9 months postpartum were precipitated by greater perceived coparenting support, but a similar effect was not observed for mothers. The third presentation focuses on PSE and early persistent infant behavior disturbance (i.e., excessive crying, sleeping and feeding difficulties in the first year postpartum). The study included 80 first-time mothers participating in a residential parent-infant intervention with an unsettled infant. Results show clear associations between infant behavior and PSE, and support the effectiveness of the intervention with respect to both variables. Associations between PSE and various maternal variables including depression and anxiety, attachment security and perceived parenting during childhood will also be reported and discussed.

Worldwide, the number of people aged 60 and over will increase from about 600 million in 2000 to almost 2000 million in 2050, of whom about half will reside in Asia. During the second half of the twentieth century, countries in Asia and the Pacific region have experienced unparalleled declines in mortality and fertility. The present paper examines the impact of the growth of the ageing population on women\u2019s well being. The challenges for setting gender-sensitive policies for women and the elderly are discussed in the context of Hong Kong and the Asia-Pacific region. Also, the contribution of the ESCAP and MIPAA in addressing gender issues in ageing population has been looked into. The paper concludes that in Asian societies, ageing issues are generating an active debate about gender, the family, the organization of the workplace, and the policy approaches to address these challenges. Given the fact that people over 65 will constitute close to onequarter of the population in Asia by 2050, and over one-third of the population in Hong Kong by that time, more refined age grouping with sex-disaggregated data will provide a more useful data base for policy-makers and researchers.

The structural components of the areas (land use and landscape elements) thus appear to be more resilient than the socio-economic system (declining number of full-time farmers and increasing number of owners engaged in other gainful activities).

Christine Chung, a trial attorney from the United States who appears in the film, was among the ICC officials who during a nine-month investigation documented hundreds of attacks and thousands of killings, often from eyewitnesses who themselves bore the scars of brutal violence. The ICC indicted two ringleaders, Joseph Kony and Vincent Otti, but more than a year later no arrests had been made, because the ICC has no law enforcement division and relies on the ability and volition of its members to carry out arrests. Meanwhile LRA leaders swayed public opinion against the ICC, portraying them as obstacles to peace for their refusal to grant amnesty. Efforts to prosecute warlords in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and paramilitary leaders in Colombia were similarly painstaking, with meager results. The apparent complicity of the Sudanese government in the genocide in Darfur has presented the ICC with its greatest challenge. The ICC has indicted four individuals, including the president, Omar al-Bashir, but it has not secured the necessary cooperation to make an arrest. Sudan does not belong to the ICC, and it has enough support on the UN Security Council to prevent that body from taking actions required under the ICC constitution. The film presents a bleak picture of the ICC in the first years of its existence. To date it has not convicted a single person. Prosecution of individuals responsible for gross crimes in one country by an international court located thousands of miles away is exceedingly difficult, not least because the legal system itself sets stringent rules to ensure justice even for people who have committed the most heinous crimes. Visually, the face of the ICC in this film is often that midrise building in The Hague, rather sterile-looking despite a post-modern flourish, far removed from the visual richness of human faces scarred by suffering in the \u201creal world\u201d where conflicts and crimes take place on iron-rich red soil, amidst lush green vegetation. Slightly objectionable in the film is the staging of scenes, such as ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo walking on a beach or through the courtroom, which draws attention to the overall weakness of the visuals in that part of the story. To the historian, however, The Reckoning effectively captures the background and early years of the ICC as an inching struggle, concluding bleakly that the ICC\u2019s challenge in the next twenty years is to become what it was supposed to be.

This observation underscores the potential that the behavioral deficit observed in earlier hatchery-propagated D. antillarum can be mediated and ecologically functional individuals can be produced through this aquaculture process.\n", "doi": "10.5343/bms.2022.0054", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Bulletin of Marine Science", "venue": "Bulletin of marine science", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Phylogenetic relationships of four Scylla species based on three kinds of mitochondrial sequences", "abstract": "Most research supports the idea that there are four species in genus Scylla.Their phylogeny,however,has not been fully understood,especially the interrelationships among S.serrata,S.paramamosain and S.tranquebarica.We analyzed the sequences of 12S rRNA,16S rRNA and COI gene in all four species of genus Scylla and established the phylogenetic tree by using Bayesian,Maximum Likehood(ML),and Neighbor Joining(NJ) approaches after the sequences were concatenated and partitioned.All three methods produced the same topology.The sister-group relationship between S.paramamosain and S.tranquebarica was highly supported by both Bayesian and ML approaches,with bootstrap value of 95% and Bayesian posterior probability of 1.0.S.serrata was the sister group of S.paramamosain and S.tranquebarica(bootstrap = 60%,Bayesian posterior probability = 0.95),while S.olivacea was found as the basal group to the other three species.The phylogenetic interrelationships among the four species of genus Scylla were uncovered in this study,which may provide molecular evidence for classification of genus Scylla.", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of Tropical Oceanography", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Sanitary and Hydrobiological Assessment of the State of the River Section of the Kanev Reservoir in terms of the Structural Indices of Microphytobenthos Algae Cenoses", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1615/HYDROBJ.V48.I5.50", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Hydrobiological Journal", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Estudio comparativo del contenido de \u00e1cido c\u00edtrico y vitamina C en el jugo de algunas variedades de Citrus de uso popular", "abstract": "The citric acid and ascorbic acid contents were measured in the ten most common citrus fruit varieties of Costa Rica.

It was developed by the Space Development & Test Directorate (SD) of the USAF Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) with prime contractor Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. (BATC) STP-SIV provides the space community with a defined yet configurable standard spacecraft-to-payload interface on which to base payload designs for rapid mission development. Rather than designing a unique spacecraft for each payload, the standards provide adaptable interfaces to accommodate a range of payloads. The flexibility to make payload manifest decisions after completion of spacecraft bus integration was demonstrated on both the first (STPSat-2) and second (STPSat-3) SIV missions. For STPSat-2, which is currently on-orbit, accommodation included the late addition of a new 3rd payload after the bus was complete. For STPSat-3, the ability to rapidly accommodate new payloads was demonstrated by the manifest of replacement payloads following cancellation of one primary instrument, with only harness and bracket modifications. In both cases, payloads were added and removed without impacting the baseline design, the spacecraft bus, or the ILC date. This paper will discuss how a wide range of payloads can be rapidly accommodated though the use of a Standard Interface Vehicle, as demonstrated on the STPSat-2 and STPSat-3 missions.

We find them in a ring of HI around the galaxy. Using the Multi-Slit Imaging Spectroscopy Technique (MSIS), we detected a total of seven H\u03b1 emitters in the south part of the tidal tail of the galaxy NGC2865. These regions are young sources with stellar masses in the range 4x103M\u2299 to 2x10 6 M\u2299, overlapping the location of the low density intergalactic HI gas, where the probability to form stars is expected to be low. For one of the intergalactic HII regions we estimated a solar oxygen abundance, 12 + log(O/H) \u223c 8.7. Given these proprieties, the regions are considered young star forming regions, born in-situ from a pre-enriched gas which has been removed from the host galaxies in a merger event. In this work we present new Gemini spectroscopy using the novel MSIS technique. We detected seven intergalactic H\u03b1 emitters in a field of view of 5\u00d7 5 centered on the south tidal debris of the elliptical galaxy NGC2865, down to a flux of 10 erg cm s A. Using the H\u03b1 line we infer an average star formation rate for these regions of <10 M\u2299 yr . The low SFRs are consistent with the fact that they are located in low density HI gas. The detection of H\u03b1 emission suggests that the last burst that gave birth to the stars was no longer than 30 Myr ago. Considering that H\u03b1 traces massive star formation and that 30 Myr is the typical life-time for this type of stars. We detected and analysed GALEX FUV and NUV data for five of these intergalactic HII regions around NGC2865. These UV sources have ages <200 Myr and span a wide range of masses (1.7\u00d710 to 5.0\u00d710 M\u2299).

The transcriptome sequencing data of artesunate in the inhibition of osteoclast differentiation were analyzed to obtain differentially expressed genes(DEGs). GraphPad Prism 8 software was used to plot volcano maps and heat maps were plotted through the website of bioinformatics. GeneCards and OMIM were used to collect information on key targets of bone destruction in RA. The DEGs of artesunate in inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and key target genes of bone destruction in RA were intersected by the Venny 2.1.0 platform, and the intersection target genes were analyzed by Gene Ontology(GO)/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) enrichment. Finally, the receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB(RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation model and collagen-induced arthritis(CIA) model were established. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction(q-PCR), immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry were used to verify the pharmacological effect and molecular mechanism of artesunate in the treatment of bone destruction in RA. In this study, the RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation model in vitro was established and intervened with artesunate, and transcriptome sequencing data were analyzed to obtain 744 DEGs of artesunate in inhibiting osteoclast differentiation. A total of 1 291 major target genes of bone destruction in RA were obtained from GeneCards and OMIM. The target genes of artesunate in inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and the target genes of bone destruction in RA were intersected to obtain 61 target genes of artesunate against bone destruction in RA. The intersected target genes were analyzed by GO/KEGG enrichment. According to the results previously reported, the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathway was selected for experimental verification. Artesunate intervention in the RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation model showed that artesunate inhibited CC chemokine receptor 3(CCR3), CC chemokine receptor 1(CCR1) and leukemia inhibitory factor(LIF) mRNA expression in osteoclasts in a dose-dependent manner compared with the RANKL-induced group. Meanwhile, the results of immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry showed that artesunate could dose-dependently reduce the expression of CCR3 in osteoclasts and joint tissues of the CIA rat model in vitro.

Lewis, 138 S. Ct. 1612 (2018), the Supreme Court ruled that an employer did not violate the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) when it required employees to agree to arbitrate all claims against the employer and also waive their rights to bring a class or collective action against the employer. The Court reasoned that class or collective actions were not the type of \u201cconcerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection\u201d that Section 7 of the NLRA protects. This comment, part of a three-part discussion on the impact of Epic Systems, discusses the impact of the decision on federal labor and employment policy. The Epic Systems case, like many of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent arbitration decisions, highlights the sometimes dissonant interplay between two previously separate bodies of law that have converged in the last 27 years: 1) the legal doctrine developed under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which Congress passed in 1925 to allow for federal court enforcement of arbitration agreements; and 2) legal doctrines arising from federal labor, employment discrimination, and worker protection laws that include the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Fair Labor Standards Act. \n \nThe comment concludes that the most immediate and direct impact of the Epic Systems ruling falls largely on non-unionized non-transportation workers who have been required to waive their right to bring a class or collective action against their employers. It is now clear that those workers cannot rely on NLRA \u00a7 7 to void their waivers. The ruling also narrowed the breadth of the rights protected by the NLRA. In addition, because it is based on the FAA, Epic Systems carries forward the differing treatment of transportation workers and all other workers under the FAA that the Supreme Court announced in the Circuit City case. Since Circuit City established that contracts of employment of transportation workers were exempt from the FAA, Epic Systems and all the other Supreme Court decisions concerning the enforceability of arbitration agreements and class action waivers under the FAA do not apply to them. However, all other workers are subject to the FAA jurisprudence that allows for enforcement of almost any agreement having to do with arbitration. This is not consistent with federal labor and employment policy embodied in anti-discrimination, worker protection, and collective bargaining laws, which do not treat transportation workers differently from non-transportation workers. The Epic Systems case only heightens that inconsistency.", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of Dispute Resolution", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Book review: Social Theory in the Twentieth Century and Beyond", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1177/0950017011398900", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Work, Employment & Society", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "THE SITUATION OF THE ITALIAN MANUFACTURING", "abstract": "52 1. THE SITUATION OF THE ITALIAN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY The Italian Industry 4.0 plan was born following the German one. It depends on the deep integration of a large part of the industrial system of northern Italy with the German one. SMEs are an important element of national and regional strategies; but in the case of Italy, for the main industrial sectors, the risk is that these companies are increasingly dependent on OEMs of the different value chains. The OEMs are often located in other countries. This is particularly true for companies located in the North West and the North East of Italy. There are some idiosyncratic aspects of the Italian industrial structure, also stressed by the government, which make it particularly subject to being affected by Industry 4.0. Especially in the sectors producing machines for industrial automation and components (mechanics and mechatronics), SMEs are clustered in industrial districts which would become more and more integrated with a reduction of the distance, within the value chains, between suppliers and subcontractors. Besides, SMEs has different challenges to cope with, depending on the sector. The widespread idea in the business community is that what should be appropriate for many SMEs is a retrofitting strategy. This is not suitable for SMEs that depends on global or EU value chain in which the OEMs are still on the edge of the process. The Government\u2019s plan includes five intervention areas.

Robert Flanagan also insists, ten chapters earlier, that though different ational institutional regimes are apparent, there has been \" an international trend towards the decentralization of collective bargaining (however, his statistics reveal exceptions and a degree of stability) . The point is taken furthest by Charles Heckscher, who, in his intriguing theoretical essay, argues that we are \"currently experiencing a transition... from the neo-corporatist system which dominated the industrial era to an as-yet uninstitutionalized and unnamed system for the future\" (360). It is with reference to change in industrial relations that the main weaknesses in the collection become clear. First, although the section on IR outcomes explores some areas of relative change and potential new areas of inquiry, these could have been embedded more firmly and explored more systematically across the collection. Readers were sold short, for example, on Pocock's excellent but too-brief chapter on equality at work; it requires a fuller treatment across the text. Further, the time it takes to produce a collection of this magnitude means that data presented can often be overtaken by events (in some chapters the data seemed dated) . The processes and consequences of restructuring are considered most explicitly, et rather tangentially, in the three chapters engaging with the high performance paradigm (Procter, Chap. 8; Frost, Chap. 22; Delaney, Chap. 33), with a degree of repetition. More consideration could have been given to the role of multinationals in reshaping industrial relations, the consequences for workers, and labor standards more generally. Moreover, though a number of chapters reference future societal challenges, such as population aging, this has yet to influence industrial relations research and scholarship in any meaningful sense. The second main weakness relates to geography. The international scope of the text is rather limited. In fairness, ome cross national comparison exists, and a number of chapters (including Pocock's) are globally situated. But the main focus is on the United States and the United Kingdom (which in some cases is painfully parochial) ,typically with reference to Europe and Japan by way of comparison, thus setting the agenda for future industrial relations research. Understanding change in industrial relations will necessitate not only a consideration of new workplace concerns and societal challenges but also the adoption of more international perspectives.

diagnosis and differential diagnosis of LBL/ALL. Methods: 53 cases of LBL/ALL were collected at shanghai Tongji Hospital from January 2012 to December 2019. The protein expression of LEF1 and TdT was detected by immunohistochemistry in 53 paraffin-embedded tissue samples of LBL/ALL. The specificity and sensitivity of LEF1 and TdT in the diagnosis of LBL/ALL were compared. The expression of LEF1 protein in 77 cases of small B-cell lymphomas including chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphoid lymphoma (CLL/SLL), follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma was studied. The correlation between LEF1 expression and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was performed by univariate analysis. Results: The expression of LEF1 in LBL/ALL was 100% (53/53), the median value was 90%; the expression of TdT was 84.9% (T-LBL/ALL 78.1%, B-LBL/ALL 95.2%), the median value was 80%; the expression rate and median value of LEF1 and TdT were significantly different (P=0.008 and 0.001 respectively). The expression of LEF1 in CLL/SLL was 14/18, the median value was 45%; LEF1 was not expressed in follicular lymphoma (0/16), mantle cell lymphoma (0/16), marginal zone lymphoma (0/19), and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (0/8). LEF1 expression was significantly different between B-LBL/ALL and small B-cell lymphomas. The median follow-up time of LBL/ALL cases in this group was 16 months. There was no statistical difference between LEF1 expression and the OS and PFS in LBL/ALL patients. Conclusions: Immunohistochemical staining of LEF1 has high sensitivity and good specificity in the diagnosis of LBL/ALL, and its combination with TdT can improve the diagnostic rate of LBL/ALL.", "doi": "10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20200513-00379", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology", "venue": "Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "[Practical consideration on vascular patterns in pathologic diagnosis of central nervous system tumors].", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology", "venue": "Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "[Study of EML4-ALK fusion gene as a biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer].", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology", "venue": "Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de d\u00e9tection de s\u00e9quences d'acide nucl\u00e9ique sp\u00e9cifiques", "abstract": "La presente invention concerne un procede et un kit de test pour detecter des sequences d'acide nucleique specifiques, comprenant les etapes 1. nouvelle synthese matrice-dependante de l'acide nucleique cible, 2. hybridation de sonde specifique a la cible et 3. detection de l'evenement d'hybridation.

We verified that the exponential growth of congestion window (cwnd) in the uncoupled Slow-Start (SS) leads to not only unfairness to TCP but also buffer overflow due to burst data. Moreover, these algorithms cannot support fair bandwidth sharing among TCP/MPTCP flows before reaching convergence at the bottleneck, which may reduce the transmission efficiency of short flows and even hurts long flows. In this paper, we propose a Throughput Consistency Congestion Control (TCCC) algorithm consisting of Coupled Slow-Start (CSS) and Aggressive Congestion Avoidance (ACA). To prevent packet loss caused by excessive burst data, CSS couples the increment of subflows\u2019 cwnd and reset the ssthresh value to safely move the flows to CA when it achieves expected throughput. Based on CSS, ACA periodically detects path states and allocates the same throughput increment as the best TCP to subflows to achieve fair bandwidth share in CA. Finally, we implement TCCC in both NS3 and real testbed.

This allows to correlate the electrical stress caused by lightning and the electrical strength of the insulations, both having probabilistic nature. This chapter provides an example of lightning insulation coordination. Specifically, it deals with the statistical appraisal of the so-called lightning performance of distribution systems, carried out by means of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The relevant application to both the cases of direct and indirect lightning events, considering the correlation between the probability distributions of the lightning current parameters, is described and discussed. In particular, the application to the indirect events is based on the definition of a surface around the power line and on the calculation of the induced voltages along the line caused by indirect events having stroke location uniformly distributed within such a surface. The result obtained through the MC simulations is fmally scaled taking into account the annual number of fl ashes per square kilometer expected in the region of interest. In order to obtain significant results, two aspects need to be considered: the surface around the power line should be large enough in order to collect all the events that may endanger the insulation, and the density of the stroke locations should be sufficiently high. Therefore, for medium voltage systems, or even more for the case of low voltage ones, the area can reach a large value indeed, and the number of events to be considered can be consequently huge.

The well spacing was reduced to half of its original value, and all infill wells were producers. In this paper, we present some key findings from the success stories and lessons learned from the failure cases.\n The fields of Samra, Asala, Diyur, North Diyur, Yomna, E Bah-C, E Bah-D, E Bah-E, and E Bah-F were developed by waterflooding either from the start of production or after a short period of depletion production. After approximately 2 years of production, high-water-production rates were observed although these fields did not achieve their planned recovery. Several analyses were carried out and showed that significant remaining oil existed. Reasons identified for bypassed oil include lateral-pay discontinuities, completion inconsistencies, and a high level of heterogeneity.\n Drilling a significant number of infill wells was the key technology suggested to recover bypassed reserves. Initially, the well spacing was approximately 450 m between producer/producer and injector/injector pairs. The well spacing was reduced to a maximum of 300 m to connect pay intervals better, especially for the Upper Baharyia (UBah) Formation reservoir, owing to its high complexity and heterogeneity level.\n After implementing the infill drilling within the nine main fields, a comprehensive monitoring plan was executed to observe the recovery improvement. Six fields (i.e., Samra, Asala, Diyur, North Diyur, Yomna, and E Bah-D) recorded additional reserves by infill drilling and the other three fields (i.e., E Bah-C, E Bah-E, and E Bah-F) did not achieve the expected increase. Comprehensive integrated analyses revealed that the heterogeneity level and maturity (age) of the waterflood were the main controlling factors in the success of infill drilling.\n Five main lessons learned are presented (supported with data) for the successful implementation of infill drilling in low-permeability and heterogeneous reservoirs.

Also, given the explanations of the *qattal(a)t pattern in the comparative Semitic literature, (\u2018sin\u2019) is best understood as an abstract substantive derived from, or viewed as a counterpart to, the *qattal noun (\u2018sinful\u2019, \u2018[habitual] sinner\u2019), with perhaps a secondary association with malady \u2014 another common semantic connotation of Biblical Hebrew *qattalt.", "doi": "10.1093/jss/fgaa024", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of Semitic Studies", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Die fr\u00fchen Christen und ihre Welt", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1628/978-3-16-157468-9", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Bertrand, Russell\u2019s Theory of Knowledge by Elizabeth Ramsden Eames (review)", "abstract": "The aim of this book is to establish that Bertrand Russell's philosophy embodies a presuppositional and methodological unity as well as a consistency in development. Toward this end the author studies four key areas of Russell's thought: 1) his conception of philosophy; 2) his method of analysis; 3) his empiricism; 4) his realism. The basic philosophical questions to which Russell returns again and again are epistemological; hence, if there is any unity to be found in his philosophy, it will center around his theory of knowledge. The title of the volume, therefore, should not mislead; Mrs. Eames really purports to supplement eariler studies by men such as Fritz, Gotlind and Weitz, by presenting a comprehensive survey of Russell's entire philosophy. In Chapter One the author notes that Russell is a philosopher who has frequently been subject to misinterpretation. This is due partly to his conception of philosophical method as hypothetical in the fashion of natural science. There must be constant testing, revision, and rejection. Thus, according to the author, Russell's philosophy must be viewed in its entirety for an accurate appraisal of his thought. Yet many interpreters, such as W. T. Stace, A. W. Levi, and W. V. Quine, tend to view Russell as a museum piece, a thinker seminal for logical empiricists and language analysts, without noting that his own thought has developed so that he can be identified with neither of these positions. In Chapter Two Mrs. Eames discusses her first major theme: Russell's conception of the nature of philosophy. Several distinctions aid the exposition. First, one must note the context of Russell's statements on the subject. Thus when he says that philosophy is \" an unusually ingenious attempt to think fallaciously,\" he means to criticize what philosophy has been; whereas when he says, \" philosophy arises from an unusually obstinate attempt to arrive at real knowledge,\" he is referring to what, in his mind, philosophy ought to be. What it ought to be will surprise those not familiar with his later thought. For, although he argues for the use of logic in philosophy, philosophy should not be a purely formal discipline. Rather, his empiricism puts him on the \"other side \" of the philosophical revolution he began; that is, his concerns are the traditional ones: the nature of the world, the nature and possibility of knowledge, etc. Philosophy should be analytical but based on experience of the real world: in Mrs. Eames' words, philosophy", "doi": "10.1353/THO.1970.0034", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "The Thomist: A Speculative Quarterly Review", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "OUP accepted manuscript", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/jss/fgab018", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal Of Semitic Studies", "venue": "Journal of Semitic Studies", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Phenomenology: A Basic Introduction in the Light of Jesus Christ.

One of the most striking issues about A mdo in general, including the Reb kong region, is its ethnic complexity. In A mdo, though, while the lamas may have been local Tibetans who went off to study in Central Tibet, the patrons were mainly Mongol, and the whole process was part of the gradual 'Tibetanisation' of the area at several levels, cultural and linguistic as well as religious.

Much points to the water mills of Scandinavia having been an ideal environment for the generation and maintenance of supernatural narrative as explored by Lauri Honko and David J. Hufford. Their approaches are different, but both illuminate parts of the tradition.

Unlike air power, however, policy makers and strategists do not have an adequate framework to address the nature of cyberspace. Without this understanding, the operationalization of cyberspace beyond broad policy statements and rhetoric will be lacking, and planners and strategists will be unable to forge capabilities over the long term. The alignment of USCYBERCOM under USSTRATCOM is not congruent with the nature of operations in cyberspace and, instead, USCYBERCOM should align itself operationally with U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). Despite its joint construct, the rationale for the placement of USCYBERCOM under USSTRATCOM remains unclear.

The impact of the projects on water levels along a branch were determined using model simulations. Berends et al. (2019) have shown that under the influence of uncertain roughness parameters in the hydraulic model, the amount of water level reduction of an intervention is uncertain. Also in the vicinity of the bifurcation points of the river Rhine, several interventions were implemented, e.g. the dike relocation at Nijmegen-Lent and floodplain excavation at the Millingerwaard. Without counteracting measures, these projects are expected to influence the distribution of discharge at the bifurcation points. Gensen et al. (2020) have shown that a river bifurcation provides a selfregulating mechanism for water levels throughout the river system. For example, a high water level in a branch is counteracted by a decrease in discharge towards this branch. In this study, we assess the uncertainty of the impact of a river intervention along a branch in the bifurcating Dutch river Rhine system. Here, impact is the change in water levels along the branch after the intervention is done. The uncertainty of the impact of an intervention scales with the amount of impact itself (Berends et al. 2019). Therefore, we hypothesize that under the self-regulating mechanism in a bifurcating river system the impact of an intervention reduces as well as its uncertainty.", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Reply on RC1", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.5194/NHESS-2020-418-AC1", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Risk zoning model of typhoon disasters", "abstract": "Typhoons happen frequently with serious consequences,so it is important to assess their risk.This paper takes Ningbo city as the example,draws the zoning map of typhoon disaster for the city using a risk zoning model,which was built on the basis of the membership function and natural disaster risk theory,while considering the hazard,exposure and vulnerability of typhoons,and applying the GIS technology.The effectiveness of the model was verified by disaster levels.The results show that,the overall risk indices of Ninghai,Yinzhou,Yuyao,Fenghua,Xiangshan and Cixi are relatively higher in counties and urban districts in Ningbo,while the indices of the old city(Haishu,Jiangdong,Jiangbei districts),Zhenhai and Beilun are lower;the risk levels of typhoon disasters in the southeast coastal cities and towns and some mountain areas are high;disaster level and risk index has a good correlation,with the coefficient of determination reaching 0.7181 and the confidence interval passed 0.01.", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of Natural Disasters", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "hydrological prediction using mesoscale ensemble", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.5194/nhess-2018-343-rc1", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "\u2018Desert Island\u2019 Detention: Detainees\u2019 Understandings of \u2018Law\u2019 in the UK\u2019s Immigration Detention System", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/RSQ/HDY020", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Refugee Survey Quarterly", "venue": "Refugee Survey Quarterly", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}], "fisheries": [{"title": "Gobiodon winterbottomi , a New Goby ( Actinopterygii : Perciformes : Gobiidae ) from Iriomote-jima Island , the Ryukyu Islands , Japan", "abstract": "The gobiid sh Gobiodon winterbottomi is described as a new species from three specimens (19.0\u201332.9 mm SL) collected from Echinopora lamellose, the plate-shaped coral of the family Faviidae, in 5 m depth on the reef slope off Iriomote-jima Island, the Ryukyu Islands, Japan.

The optimal amount of phosphorus supplementation in commercial feeds is important not only economically,but also for environmental reasons. Phosphorus metabolism in cultured aquatic species has become a popular research subject,due to rising concerns about phosphorus discharged into aquaculture environment. The present experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary phosphorus on growth performance,body composition,bone mineralization and blood chemistry index of juvenile rice field eel( Monopterus albus). Five practical diets were formulated to contain graded levels( 0.67%,0.91%,1. 05%,1. 29% and 1. 53%) of phosphorus from dietary ingredients and monocalcium phosphate.

NG-MAST utilises DNA sequencing of two variable regions of the N. gonorrhoeaegenome to classify gonococcal isolates into strain types. Method We assessed the genetic diversity of N. gonorrhoeaeisolates in Baltimore (N = 277) spanning the years 2009\u20132011 compared to San Francisco (N = 539) from 2005\u20132011, using NG-MAST. All isolates in this project were obtained from the CDC Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP). San Francisco strains were mostly from MSM, while the Baltimore isolates were mostly from a heterosexual population. Results NG-MAST results from isolates across that time period revealed a surprising degree of sequence type turnover within the Baltimore area. When compared to the data from San Francisco, the N. gonorrhoeaegenetic diversity trends revealed minimal overlap in sequence families between the two metropolitan areas; SF8238, SF210, and SF 2992 were present in both populations. However, a pair-wise comparison of other strain families revealed two relatively distinct populations; the most prevalent strain families in San Francisco were SF437, SF23, SF3935, and SF1407, while those in Baltimore were SF8234, SF8240, SF865, and SF8262. Conclusion These data may imply that the traditional understanding of a gonococcal transmission pattern from west to east cannot accurately depict the strain flow of N. gonorrhoeaeisolates within these populations. Our data revealed a large amount of strain turnover in both metropolitan areas by year. This raises questions about the entry and transmission of N. gonorrhoeae within the U.S., and the implications of this turnover in regards to the evolution of this organism.", "doi": "10.1136/sextrans-2013-051184.0100", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Sexually Transmitted Infections", "venue": "Sexually Transmitted Infections", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Examining the State of Communication about Sexual and Reproductive Health Information Between Youth with Disability and Healthcare Providers", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/J.JADOHEALTH.2013.10.116", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of Adolescent Health", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Elevated Liver Enzymes with Naltrexone Might Not Indicate Toxicity", "abstract": "The mu-opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone, which is approved for the treatment of alcohol and opiate dependence, has a black-box warning for", "doi": "10.1056/JP201212030000004", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "NEJM Journal Watch", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Extreme criminal penalties - death penalty and life imprisonment in the Polish penal and penitentiary system", "abstract": "In the article we analysed how the introduction and application of life imprisonment in the period of transformation has impacted the development of the penitentiary system to date.

There is no controversy that newborn infants with clinical signs consistent with possible sepsis should be investigated and treated promptly with antibiotics. The question is what should be done for clinically well infants with risk factors? They are at higher risk of becoming ill than the background population but the absolute risk is still low. Large numbers of such infants are screened and treated for every case of proven sepsis. There is likely to be advantage to the infants with infection being treated early while still free of clinical signs, but what about the disadvantages to the large number of infants treated unnecessarily. Goel and colleagues followed the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline in a population of 3593 infants born at >34 weeks gestation in eight hospitals in Wales and also assessed what would have been recommended had the infants instead been managed using the Kaiser Permanente Sepsis Risk Calculator (SRC). There were 576 (16%) infants treated with antibiotics according to the NICE guideline. The SRC would have recommended antibiotics for 156 (4.3%) and additional observations for a further 112. Overall, 54.5% of the infants flagged for intervention by the NICE guideline would have received standard newborn care if the SRC was used instead. There were six infants with culture proven EOS during the study and the two approaches individually each identified 3 of them. The others presented later with clinical signs. Both riskbased approaches have uncertain overall risks and benefits and will not identify all cases. A prospective comparative evaluation of the two approaches is being undertaken.See pages F118 and F116 pRemedication foR intubation Although most clinicians now use premedication for planned intubation in newborn infants, the regimen of choice varies and remains uncertain. Linda Truong and colleagues measured blood pressure, cardiac output and cerebral regional oxygen saturation during 37 intubation episodes where the infants received atropine, fentanyl or morphine, and cisatracurium. Ten of the infants had a greater than 20% decline blood pressure prior to first blade insertion which persisted for an average of 15 min. There were not significant associated changes in cerebral oxygenation or cardiac output. We still need better data to guide premedication for neonatal intubation, at least in infants at risk of intraventricular haemorrhage.

Methods Three syringe drivers (Alaris CC (Becton Dickinson), Perfusor Space (B Braun), and Synamed \u03bcSP6000 (Arcomed)) were analysed for reliability of flow at 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 ml/hr. A small air bubble was introduced into the giving set, and the progression of this was documented before and after a vertical movement of the syringe driver by 25 or 50 cm upwards or downwards relative to the delivery port. Results For all pumps, delivery was interrupted on movement of the pumps downwards, and a bolus was given with movement of the pump upwards. Delivery halted at lower pump speeds for longer than higher pump speeds. The maximum delivery interruption was 11.8 minutes. Boluses given on moving the pump up were calculated as the equivalent number of minutes needed to deliver the bolus volume at steady state. The maximum bolus given was equivalent to 15.8 minutes of delivery. We were unable to eliminate the effects seen by very slow, steady movement of the pumps up or down. Static height differences made no difference to delivery. Conclusions Syringe drivers should not be moved vertically in relation to the patient. Critical drug delivery is interrupted for up to 12 minutes with relative downward movements, and significant boluses of drugs are given with relative upward movements. As far as possible, elimination of relative height movements is advised, and extreme caution is necessary if any movements are unavoidable.", "doi": "10.1136/archdischild-2020-NPPG.65", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Archives of Disease in Childhood", "venue": "Archives of Disease in Childhood", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}], "international relations": [{"title": "The Comparative Politics of Immigration: Policy Choices in Germany, Canada, Switzerland, and the United States\u00a0Antje\u00a0Ellermann.

First, with an increasing number of peacebuilding interventions by the international community and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), addressing environmental issues in post-conflict contexts has become a major concern. This is especially so as water and land are crucial for (re-)building livelihoods while modern wars produce considerable environmental damage. Second, an increasing number of scholars and policymakers are expressing concerns about the security implications of global environmental change, with the impact of climate change on violent conflict being a particularly salient topic. A focus on environmental cooperation and its potential peace-enhancing effects provides a complementary analytical perspective that can counter determinist and securitizing environmental conflict narratives. Environmental peacebuilding can be broadly defined as efforts to build more peaceful relations through conflict prevention, resolution, and recovery processes that integrate the management of environmental issues. In this context, peace refers to negative peace (the absence of physical violence) as well as positive peace (the absence of structural violence and the inconceivability of physical violence). Environmental peacebuilding can take place at the macro level (e.g., between states) as well as on the meso level and the micro level (e.g., between or within local communities). Environmental peacebuilding includes four sets of practices (which are not mutually exclusive): First, with resources like water or land becoming increasingly scarce in some regions and oil or mining projects often being heavily contested, preventing conflicts over natural resources is increasingly important. Second, in post-conflict contexts, natural resources must be managed well, for instance to reduce land-related grievances or prevent conflict financing through resource revenues. Third, climate change mitigation, adaptation to environmental change, and disaster risk reduction (DRR) can reduce grievances and promote community coherence. Finally, joint and severe environmental problems can act as entry points for cooperation across political divides, hence supporting processes of trust building and deepening interdependence (the respective set of practices is often termed environmental peacemaking). These practices can also fail, however, implying that they have no impact on environmental problems or peace processes. In the worst case, environmental peacebuilding practices can even facilitate new forms of exclusion, conflict, and environmental degradation. Over the past two decades, interest in environmental peacebuilding has grown remarkably, not at least due to the intensification of environmental problems and recent trends toward a less peaceful world. As a result of these developments, the literature on environmental peacebuilding has grown dramatically.", "doi": "10.1093/obo/9780199743292-0290", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "International Relations", "venue": "International Relations", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "The Growth of North Korea\u2019s Spontaneous Pseudo-Entrepreneurs and the Characteristics of Their Informal Networks", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.17321/RNKS.2020.23.2.001", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Review of North Korean Studies", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "The Afghanistan Papers: A Secret History of the War by Craig Whitlock (review)", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "The Middle East Journal", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Rechtleitung und Irregehen \u2013 Lebensf\u00fchrung zwischen Fatalismus und eigener Verantwortung", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-658-29572-1_14", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Contribution of Educational System Quality and Health Condition to Welcome Demographic Bonus in Indonesia", "abstract": "Demographic transition that occurs in the last decade in Indonesia will open opportunities for it to be able to achieve demographic bonus in 2020-2030.

Curione was a professional teacher who presented his ideas about education in several works, mainly Schola, sive de perfecto Grammatico, and two versions of the catechism Instruction in the Christian faith. The authors assert the principle dualism of Curione\u2019s views, who subordinated the methods of humanistic pedagogy to the Christian ministry. Many of his ideas are typical of Italian humanism, including attention to language training and general respect for the personality of the pupil. At the same time, Curione aims at the upbringing of a true Christian, a member of the society renewed during the Reformation. Having analysed the works by Curione, the authors show how he consistently developed the idea of labour pedagogy, considering labour the only virtual possibility of correcting the sinful nature of a man. Another important aspect is the humanist\u2019s attention to family pedagogy. In the spirit of Protestant individualism, Curione saw the significance of a family as a small Church, with upbringing of children being the most important parental task.", "doi": "10.1080/00309230.2019.1690007", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Paedagogica Historica", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Zuzana \u0160idlikov\u00e1, Lost (m)ODE, Clothing Culture in Slovakia from 1945 to 1989", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1080/00404969.2019.1653648", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Textile History", "venue": "Textile History", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}], "social work": [{"title": "Review of Fragile Families: Foster Care, Immigration, and Citizenship.

There is a plethora of literature that advocates for the reconceptualisation of social work in non-western societies to align it with the values of clients being served. However, there is a dearth of literature on available indigenous social work games that can be applied particular in child counselling. Using a qualitative design, six social work practitioners, purposively sampled, were individually interviewed to explore their integration of indigenous games during child counselling. The findings indicate that through reflexivity, social workers learn and observe context-relevant knowledge from the communities they serve and that accumulated knowledge informs innovative practice interventions in social work. In this paper, children\u2019s social background, culture, play behaviours and community assets informed social workers\u2019 choice of the games they could incorporate in child counselling.

This fact results in the noncontinuity of the virtual error dynamics. This problem is ignored in the existing backstepping-based event-triggered control schemes, in which control design and stability analysis are implemented according to the continuous virtual error dynamics, namely, all the virtual control signals are required to be continuous.

In this condition, the classification accuracy of the group reached 77%, which was higher than that of the feature fusion strategy under the same group size (77.31% vs. 56.34%), and was significantly higher than that of the average single user (77.31% vs. 44.90%). The research in this paper proves that the cBCI collaboration strategy can effectively improve the MI-BCI classification performance, which lays the foundation for MI-cBCI research and its future application.", "doi": "10.7507/1001-5515.202007059", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi", "venue": "Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Network architecture strongly influences the fluid flow pattern through the lacunocanalicular network in human osteons", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10237-019-01250-1", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology", "venue": "Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Evaluation of various procedures for intraoral fixed prosthetic restoration repair", "abstract": "the present work was to determine the most appropriate resin-composite bonding procedure to metal, ceramic and zirconia substrates for fixed prosthetic restoration repair.

In this paper, the suitability of using the CIELAB and CMYK color spaces in processing and analyzing blood smear images of leukemia is assessed for comparison. Leukemia is commonly known as blood cancer and it usually leads to an abnormal proliferation of leukocytes (White Blood Cells) in the bone marrow and blood. The diagnosis of leukemia is primarily done by Pathologists by microscopically examining the blood and bone marrow smears of the suspected patient. Image processing-based methods can be used for automated detection and classification of leukemia to assist the Pathologists for a speedy diagnosis. The proposed study used [Formula: see text]-means clustering to segment the leukocytes and leukemic blast cells. The microscopic smear images in RGB color format were transformed and processed in CIELAB as well as CMYK color spaces for comparison. Statistical analysis was performed using Student\u2019s [Formula: see text] test. The visual observation of the segmented images revealed that, processing the images in the CIELAB color space is comparatively better than the CMYK color space and it is reflected in the results of statistical comparison by Student\u2019s [Formula: see text] test.

In order to improve the performance of prediction model, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to train the structure paramters of back propagation (BP) neural network. Moreover, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature and 1 550 nm absorbance were introduced as input variables of blood glucose concentration prediction model, and BP neural network was used as prediction model. In order to solve the problem that traditional BP neural network is easy to fall into local optimization, a hybrid model based on PSO-BP was introduced in this paper. The results showed that the prediction effect of PSO-BP model was better than that of traditional BP neural network. The prediction root mean square error and correlation coefficient of ten-fold cross-validation were 0.95 mmol/L and 0.74, respectively. The Clarke error grid analysis results showed that the proportion of model prediction results falling into region A was 84.39%, and the proportion falling into region B was 15.61%, which met the clinical requirements.

The comparison of towns\u2019 sizes shows that the same measures and similar schemes were used. In a medieval town each and every aspect was carefully planned and wellthought- out, but sometimes it was modified due to the terrain.

PBM induces genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic processes within target cells, but such manipulation of cell behavior has led to concerns about oncologic safety. This article presents a summary of the clinical and preclinical evidence for the oncologic safety of PBM for aesthetic skin rejuvenation. A focused systematic review was performed, in which safety data from clinical trials of PBM for skin rejuvenation was supplemented by analyses of in vitro data obtained from cells derived from human skin and human neoplastic cells and in vivo data of tumors of the skin, oral cavity, and breast. Within established parameters, red and near infrared light mainly enhances proliferation of healthy cells without a clear pattern of influence on cell viability. The same light parameters mainly reduce neoplastic cell proliferation and viability or else make no difference. Invasiveness potential (appraised by cell migration assays and/or differential gene expression) is equivocal. PBM does not induce dysplastic change in healthy cells. In vivo tumor models yield varied results with no clear pattern emerging. There are no relevant clinical trial data linking PBM with any significant adverse events, including the finding of a new or recurrent malignancy. Current clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that PBM is oncologically safe for skin rejuvenation, and there is no evidence to support the proposition that it should be avoided by patients who have previously undergone treatment for cancer.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish an expert international consensus on splenic flexure carcinoma management. DESIGN: A 3-round online-based Delphi study was conducted between September 2020 and April 2021. SETTING: The first round included 18 experts from 12 different countries. For the second and third rounds, each expert in the first round was asked to invite 2 more colorectal surgeons (n = 47). Out of 47 invited experts, 89% (n = 42) participated in the second and third rounds of the consensus. INTERVENTIONS: A total of 35 questions were created and sent via the online questionnaire tool. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Levels of recommendation based on voting concordance were graded as follows: more than 75% agreement was defined as strong, between 50% and 75% as moderate, and below 50% as weak. RESULTS: There was moderate consensus on the definition of splenic flexure (55%) as 10\u2009cm from either side where the distal transverse colon turns into the proximal descending colon. Also, experts recommended an abdominopelvic CT scan plus intraoperative exploration (moderate consensus, 72%) for tumor localization and cancer registry. Segmental colectomy was the preferred technique for the management of splenic flexure carcinoma in the elective setting (72%). Moderate consensus was achieved on the technique of complete mesocolic excision and central vascular ligation principles for splenic flexure carcinoma (74%). Only strong consensus was achieved on the surgical approach for minimally invasive surgery (88%). LIMITATIONS: Subjective decisions are based on individual expert clinical experience and not evidence based. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first internationally conducted Delphi consensus study regarding splenic flexure carcinoma. The definition of splenic flexure remains ambiguous. To more effectively compare oncologic outcomes among different cancer registries, guidelines need to be developed to standardize each domain and avoid arbitrary definitions.

ESTANDARIZACI\u00d3N DE LA DEFINICI\u00d3N Y MANEJO QUIR\u00daRGICO DEL CARCINOMA DE \u00c1NGULO ESPL\u00c9NICO ESTABLECIDO POR UN CONSENSO INTERNACIONAL DE EXPERTOS UTILIZANDO LA T\u00c9CNICA DELPHI: \u00bfESPACIO PARA MEJORAR? ANTECEDENTES: El tratamiento quir\u00fargico del c\u00e1ncer de \u00e1ngulo espl\u00e9nico sigue siendo controvertido. OBJETIVO: Establecer un consenso internacional de expertos sobre el manejo del c\u00e1ncer del \u00e1ngulo espl\u00e9nico. DISE\u00d1O: Se condujo un estudio Delphi en l\u00ednea de 3 rondas entre septiembre de 2020 y febrero de 2021. ESCENARIO: La primera ronda incluy\u00f3 a 18 expertos de 12 pa\u00edses distintos. Para la segunda y tercera rondas, a cada experto de la primera ronda se le pidi\u00f3 que invitara a 2 cirujanos colorrectales m\u00e1s de su regi\u00f3n (n = 47). De los 47 expertos invitados, el 89% (n = 42) particip\u00f3 en la segunda y tercera ronda del consenso. INTERVENCIONES: Se crearon y enviaron un total de 35 preguntas a trav\u00e9s de la herramienta de cuestionario en l\u00ednea. PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO: Los niveles de recomendaci\u00f3n basados en la concordancia de votos fueron jerarquizados de la siguiente manera: m\u00e1s del 75% de acuerdo se defini\u00f3 como fuerte, entre 50 y 75% como moderado y por debajo del 50% como d\u00e9bil. RESULTADOS: Hubo un consenso moderado sobre la definici\u00f3n de \u00e1ngulo espl\u00e9nico (55%) como 10\u2009cm desde cualquier lado donde el colon transverso distal se convierte en el colon descendente proximal. As\u00ed tambi\u00e9n, los expertos recomendaron la tomograf\u00eda computarizada abdominop\u00e9lvica m\u00e1s la exploraci\u00f3n intraoperatoria (consenso moderado, 72%) para la localizaci\u00f3n del tumor y el registro del \u00e1ngulo espl\u00e9nico. La colectom\u00eda segmentaria fue la t\u00e9cnica preferida para el tratamiento del c\u00e1ncer de \u00e1ngulo espl\u00e9nico en el caso de ser electivo (72%). Se logr\u00f3 un consenso moderado sobre la t\u00e9cnica de escisi\u00f3n completa del mesocolon y los principios de ligadura vascular a nivel central para el c\u00e1ncer de \u00e1ngulo espl\u00e9nico (74%). Solo se logr\u00f3 un fuerte consenso sobre el abordaje quir\u00fargico para la cirug\u00eda m\u00ednimamente invasiva (88%). LIMITACIONES: Decisiones subjetivas basadas en la experiencia cl\u00ednica de expertos individuales y no basadas en evidencia. CONCLUSIONES: Este es el primer estudio internacional de consenso Delphi realizado sobre el c\u00e1ncer de \u00e1ngulo espl\u00e9nico. Si bien encontramos un consenso moderado sobre las modalidades de diagn\u00f3stico preoperatorio y el manejo quir\u00fargico, la definici\u00f3n de \u00e1ngulo espl\u00e9nico sigue siendo ambigua. Para comparar de manera m\u00e1s efectiva los resultados oncol\u00f3gicos entre diferentes registros de c\u00e1ncer, se deben desarrollar pautas para estandarizar cada dominio y evitar definiciones arbitrarias.

On the contrary, the peculiarity of the international order remains in how the existence of the unique goals of each nation motivates the manner with which states engages and drives the global agenda. Nor has globalization led humanity toward a more fair and equitable distribution of wealth, a resolution to poverty or to a universal civil society. In fact, for many of the challenges facing humanity we seem to be moving further from resolve. Nowhere has this had greater impact than on the sphere of migration and peace-building. In 2015 over 60 million people were forcibly displaced globally, with over half of this population being children. The UNHCR\u2019s annual Global Trends Report indicates that this level of displacement is the highest level ever recorded. Escaping war, oppression and human rights abuses, from the moment they flee refugees inhabit an institutionalized world of non-government organizations (NGOs), intergovernmental agencies and governments within which highly developed policies and frameworks exist to deliver emergency and developmental assistance. NGOs have a crucial place in this world. Mandated to provide safe-guard, service provision and advocacy for vulnerable migrants and refugees, these organizations are equally shrouded by long-established frameworks and systems that often leave restricted to the aspiration of the donor countries that fund them, disengaged from those they seek to aid and as such unable to effect real change. What results is a public discourse that questions the relevance of NGOs rather than delving deeper. As such, some NGOs are seeking to assess and transform the way they respond to the communities they support not only as a means to remain relevant, but to elicit the humanitarian outcomes that are at the forefront of their organizational mission. There exists a great deal of literature in the field of international relations regarding the root causes and potential solutions to the swelling refugee crisis.

Different from drug prescription, medical supplies utilization is not being standardized or guided by clinical guidelines. In order to achieve the goal, many hospitals directly disable the use of the most expensive medical supplies. One missing piece in consideration is the patient heterogeneity, which decides the medical necessity for a specific surgery/procedure and the associated medical supplies requirement. The other challenge is to justify the substitutability of the medical supplies being replaced. In this study, we explore a clinical similarity based framework to analyze the inpatient medical supplies use records and detect unnecessary utilization. More specifically, the inpatient stays are clustered based on patients' clinical conditions. After clustering, inpatient cases within each sub-group should have similar clinical necessities and therefore similar medical supplies utilization patterns.

Hagiographic work of researchers contributed to the writing of monographic research, articles, artistic and artistic-journalistic works, publication of collections of documents, memoirs, epistolary and other materials. The article states that at the present stage of development of society the Russian Orthodox Church continues to preserve and increase the ancient traditions associated with the glorifi cation of the spiritual feat of our people. This is expressed primarily in the construction of churches and chapels dedicated to those saints who remained faithful to Christ and his Church in the terrible years of persecution.

The mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) to establish the chronic asthmatic model. The vehicle control group and the relaxin treatment group were subcutaneously injected with saline and relaxin (0.25 mg \u00d7 kg(-1)\u00d7 d(-1))respectively. Alteration of the airway inflammation and collagen deposition were observed by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Masson staining. Hydroxyproline in the lung was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) in lungs was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The protein expression and the mRNA of cyclin D(1) were detected by Western blot and RT-PCR respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were inflammatory cell infiltration, airway stenosis, bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy and increased collagen deposition in the asthmatic group and the vehicle control group; but these changes were significantly ameliorated in the relaxin treatment group. The area of the \u03b1-SMA-stained smooth muscle layer in the asthmatic group and the vehicle control group was significantly greater than that in the control group (all P < 0.05), while administration of relaxin decreased the \u03b1-SMA immunostained area (all P < 0.05). The lung hydroxyproline content in the asthmatic and the vehicle groups [(0.68 \u00b1 0.10) mg/g lung tissue, (0.67 \u00b1 0.10) mg/g lung tissue] was significantly greater than that in the control group [(0.26 \u00b1 0.05) mg/g lung tissue] (q = 16.61, 16.01 respectively, all P < 0.01). In contrast, treatment with relaxin significantly reduced the lung hydroxyproline content [(0.40 \u00b1 0.06) mg/g lung tissue] compared with aforementioned 2 groups (q = 10.88, 10.26 respectively, all P < 0.05). The results of the Western blot analysis showed that the expression level of cyclin D(1) in the asthmatic and the vehicle groups [(1.38 \u00b1 0.18), (1.50 \u00b1 0.10)] was higher than that in the control group (0.38 \u00b1 0.10) (q = 13.00, 14.65 respectively, all P < 0.05), while it was significantly decreased in the relaxin group (0.72 \u00b1 0.13) (q = 8.51, 10.16 respectively, all P < 0.05). There were no differences in all of the parameters between the asthmatic group and the vehicle group (P > 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nRelaxin alleviated airway inflammation, airway smooth muscle thickening and airway remodelling in a murine model of chronic asthma, partially by down-regulating the expression level of cyclin D(1).", "doi": "10.3760/CMA.J.ISSN.1001-0939.2012.05.009",

Ethereum blockchain has shown that trusted, auditable transactions is detectible using a decentralized network of nodes accompanied by a general ledger. Thus, due to the fast-moving development of educational and professional data generators such as online universities and distance learning, requires learners to engage in detail into their EPPR as well as the educational and professional data generators. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized framework to manage EPPR using Ethereum blockchain technology. The framework provides the owner of the EPPR a comprehensive immutable log and ease of access to their educational records across the educational record editors and consumers. Furthermore, it provides a recommender engine to endorse skills and competencies to the education record owners and similar candidates for educational records editors and consumers.

Methodology: bacterial isolate designated as SLK10 was obtained from the rhizosphere of tomato grown in the Al-Ahsa region, Saudi Arabia. SLK10 was further characterized morphologically, biochemically and genotypically using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The roles in alleviating salt stress effects on three important economic crops were also assessed by implementing a cross-inoculation strategy. Results: SLK10 formed a circular, non-pigmented and raised colony with an entire margin. The cells were rod shaped and Gram negative. SLK10 displayed multiple plant growth-stimulating features, such as the solubilization of inorganic phosphate and the production of phytohormones and acetoin. Comparative sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene revealed that SLK10 belonged to Pseudomonas monteilii, to which it exhibited 99.86% sequence homology. SLK10 significantly promoted the length of primary root, stem and number of leaves in Eruca sativa, Lepidium sativumand Raphanus sativus growing under 1000 ppm salt stress. The number of leaves in L. sativum and R. sativus growing under 2000 ppm salt stress was substantially enhanced by SLK10.

Th ose who exit and wind up the hill toward the old Central Business District can also park, stride onto a viewing stand, and gawk at the massive Berkeley Pit, its dark, toxic waters shimmering under that big Montana sky. Many excellent historians have tackled aspects of Butte\u2019s distinctive story, oft en focusing on its roughandtumble labor history and its vibrant ethnic cultures. In Th e City Th at Ate Itself, Brian James Leech has superbly synthesized this fascinating place\u2019s varied historical strands, capturing the upsanddowns from its Civil War\u2013 era beginnings to the still uncertain postindustrial present and future. Earlier chapters build upon and augment studies by David M. Emmons, Michael P. Malone, Mary Murphy, and others, exploring the centrality of mining in the evolution of Butte\u2019s workingclass culture and neighborhood development and the unsettling transition from underground to openpit mining. Th e second half of the book, which discusses the consuming of archetypal ethnic neighborhoods as the Pit expanded from the 1950s to the 1970s and the recent decades of coming to terms with the social and environmental costs following the Pit\u2019s closure in 1983, adds much to the city\u2019s story. Leech vividly describes post\u2013 World War II developments, such as the emerging environmental and historical preservation movements, Anaconda\u2019s farfl ung fi nancial challenges and declining prestige among Butte residents, and the jarring impacts of mine closures, beginning with the remaining underground operations in the 1970s. Th e author also skillfully pulls in a multitude of ideas orbiting in the 1960s and 1970s regarding technocratic problemsolving in addressing the deterioration of Butte\u2019s urban core. Leech concludes with an evocative summary of Butte residents\u2019 recent eff orts to reclaim not only the landscape but also community, for instance with baby boomers\u2019 revival of ethnic pride through heritage festivals and reunions for neighborhoods that literally no longer exist. Leech\u2019s sourcing for this impressive study presents a potent model for similarly ambitious scholars. Particularly notable are the use of oral history interviews (including ones he conducted) and Anaconda Company records that include correspondence regarding neighborhood residents\u2019 complaints about pit blasts and negotiations for property acquisitions to accommodate the Pit\u2019s expansion. Th ere is considerably more going on in Th e City Th at Ate Itself than can be covered in a short review: open pit work\u2019s eff ects on male workers\u2019 sense of camaraderie, independence, and status; the impacts of noise, hazards, and displacement on social geography; excellent technical descriptions of evolving mining methods.

These perceptions change over time. In Australia, native vegetation has been transformed from something to be cleared to something of intrinsic value, and landscapes from bare palettes for new agronomy species to landscapes needing strict continental quarantine. We can now conceive of environmental weeds. Amidst these trends, the effects of global warming provide novel, all pervasive, pressures of environmental change at the continental scale. Under global climate change, southeastern Australia faces a warmer, drier, extreme-weather-event punctuated (e.g. fire and flood) future, whilst inhabitants face a socio-ecological-economic future that is both water and carbon-constrained and landscapes with profound legacies. Biophysical environments and related processes are changing, and will continue to change, including abundances and distributions of biota, including weeds. Prospective biological responses of weedy species provide part of our understanding, however, socio-ecological landscape changes, frequently ignored, are vital for a more complete appreciation of appropriate long-term responses. In the context of multiple uncertainties, adaptation to climate change, including land-use and management, is an increasing societal focus. Adaptation to climate change is vital for long-term sustainability and intergenerational landscape equity and includes the resilience of agricultural and post agricultural landscapes. Perceptions of assets and ecosystem services that we value and obtain from landscapes are changing trajectories of land-use, and response to climate change may accelerate these processes (e.g. carbonsequestration). Adaptation and mitigation (of CO2 emission) strategies converge in landscapes as society seeks to increase its resilience to climate change impacts. This contribution examines the interaction of these major fluxes in relation to historic land use and our perception of weeds. Responses to climate change will accelerate Australian society's on-going re-evaluation of landscapes and services they provide, including reevaluation of 'weeds' and consequent management strategies.", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Plant protection quarterly", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Gospodarowanie zwierz\u0119tami na osadzie otwartej kultury \u0142u\u017cyckiej w Grzybianach ko\u0142o Legnicy, stanowisko 1, woj. dolno\u015bl\u0105skie", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}], "arthritis & rheumatology": [{"title": "Real-world Coronavirus disease-19 vaccine hesitancy in systemic sclerosis.", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.55563/clinexprheumatol/czllpx", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Clinical and experimental rheumatology", "venue": "Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology turns 40: serving the rheumatology community between tradition and innovation.", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.55563/clinexprheumatol/tj864s", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Clinical and experimental rheumatology", "venue": "Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "[Melanoma update].", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.revmed.2018.11.005", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "La Revue de medecine interne", "venue": "La Revue de medecine interne", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Assessing quality of life in Beh\u00e7et's disease: a systematic review.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThe assessment of quality of life (QoL) in Beh\u00e7et's disease (BD) patients has been a surrogate of disease outcomes, but a wider impact on the patient's lifestyle has not been considered.

Abstrak Studi ini menentukan faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi kelayakan pinjaman bank komersial dari usaha kecil di industri konstruksi di Afrika Selatan. Sebuah desain studi kasus ganda dan enam bisnis kecil yang dipilih secara acak (yaitu, tiga pemohon pinjaman yang berhasil dan tidak berhasil) digunakan dalam penelitian ini. Metodologi kualitatif diterapkan untuk mewawancarai tiga manajer senior dari bank komersial dan enam pejabat senior bisnis, yang telah menjalani proses penilaian. Aset perusahaan kecil mendanai aplikasi hasil klien yang diwawancarai dan hasil penilaian kredit baik surat pengaduan resmi maupun notulen juga dievaluasi setelah keputusan pemberian skor kredit dibuat untuk memperoleh data yang lebih mendalam. Temuan utama dari penelitian ini adalah bahwa hubungan dan latar belakang klien, karakter, agunan, modal, kapasitas dan keterjangkauan merupakan faktor utama dari kelayakan pinjaman dari usaha kecil di Afrika Selatan. Yang paling penting adalah bahwa, pinjaman berjangka berbasis hubungan khusus didasarkan pada hubungan bisnis yang dibangun selama bertahuntahun pinjaman, memungkinkan untuk fleksibilitas besar dalam hal pinjaman. Advances in Social Sciences Research Journal (ASSRJ) Vol.8, Issue 3, Mar-20 Copyright \u00a9 Society for Science and Education, United Kingdom 417 INTRODUCTION According to the South African Government\u2019s National Development plan and policies report (2013), 90% of new jobs should be created through Small Businesses by 2030, however progress has been disappointing (Mail Guardian, 2013). The World Bank (2013) adds that relative to larger firms, small businesses enhance competition, entrepreneurship, innovation, job creation and spur economy-wide efficiency; growth and poverty alleviation. According to the National Small Business Amendment Act (26 of 2003), a small business in the construction industry is a business with a total of 50 fulltime equivalent of paid employees, a total turnover of R6m and a total gross asset value (fixed property excluded of R1m. The SA commercial banks index (2013) revealed that the number of employers in the Small Enterprises sector has risen by 6% year on year and a growth in the number of businesses funded. However, Small Enterprises are faced with different challenges such as legislation, finance assistance and training, which lead to limited exposure and ability to expand their businesses (Financial Mail, 2013). Regardless of business operational issues and challenges faced by the Small Enterprises like compliance, regulations and policies, lack of sufficient capital and credit facilities is often a major handicap to the development or growth of small businesses, especially in the early stages. Researchers allege that globally, 95 percent of small businesses rely on their personal resources, loans from friends and families or business partners to finance such business and result to failure in business (www.moneyweb.co.za). This study focused on exploring the characteristics of small businesses whose finance applications are approved or declined after going through the assessment using the credit model of a commercial bank, the applied credit criteria by commercial banks in SA. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that affect commercial banks\u2019 loan eligibility of small businesses in the construction industry in South Africa. In South Africa, the construction industry contributes 50% market share to the commercial bank asset finance book followed by transport and the manufacturing sector LITERATURE REVIEW There is no clear evidence of what constitutes a successful-approved or unsuccessful-declined application for asset funding among small business. Most small businesses\u2019 credit requests are relatively small finance amounts and this is due to the costs of risk assessments and pricing dependent on the loan size, financed term, article type and if the article is going to be an income generating asset or not for the business (Commercial banks small businesses index, 2013). The study highlights the nature and common effects of challenges faced by growing or expanding small businesses in the construction industry. Factors for firm growth: Financial inadequacies, which according to Beck (2007) are related to farm size, are key barriers to firm growth, leading to a mismatch between Small Enterprise demand and financial Institutions\u2019 supply of finance. Entrepreneurs across various sectors are experiencing challenges in accessing financial assistance to start or grow their business through financial institutions (Maas and Herrington, 2008) and this is due to rigid lending criteria and not meeting set requirements including collateral securities (FinScope Small Business Survey, 2010). Fal (2013) pointed out that the limited number of talented and skilled workers in South Mtsweni, L., Serumaga-Zake, P. & Kruger J. W. (2020) Factors of commercial banks\u2019 loan eligibility of Small Businesses in South Africa: A construction industry case. Advances in Social Sciences Research Journal, 7(3) 416-430. URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.14738/assrj.73.7019 418 Africa means that small enterprise businesses often struggle to scale up; and that, although government had the best intentions to assist small businesses, all too often it introduced regulations that might be easy for big companies to adhere to, but which compounded the amount of red tape that smaller firms are faced with. Small Enterprise development currently faces serious constraints including the scarcity of long term financial resources like long term loans and venture capital (Wu et al, 2008) and as many entrepreneurs don\u2019t understand how to access the funds (www.mail&guardian.co.za). Asset funding: An estimated 5% of small businesses in the construction industry have received asset finance for business expansion or growth from commercial banks, but the major challenge for commercial banks is the assessment of risk in a cost-effective manner. To this end, the commercial bank developed an internal automated credit scoring scorecard to determine if the small businesses should be financed or not. Risk management: A bank regulation is a form of government regulation, which subject banks to certain requirements, restrictions and guidelines. This regulatory structure creates transparency between banking institutions and the individuals and corporations with whom they conduct business, among other things. Given the interconnectedness of the banking industry and the reliance that the national (and global) economy hold on banks, it is important for regulatory agencies to maintain control over the standardized practices of these institutions (www.globalbankreport.co.za). Commercial banks operate within a number of statutory requirements including the National Credit Act, Credit Agreement Act and Usury Act which impose additional constraints to the lending of small enterprise clients because certain requirements must be considered before the transaction is presented for consideration. Temtime and Pansiri (2004) stated that high investment in fixed assets particularly during the start-up stage, inadequately estimated capital requirements, inability or failure to analyse financial statements, misperception of turnover as profit and under-utilisation of company assets are some of the factors leading to Small Enterprise failure at the infancy stage. The advantages associated with using debt finance are: Amount borrowed can vary according to needs; It does not dilute shareholding provided it is paid back; and There is no interference by the bank provided regular payments are made. The disadvantages are: It creates a debt obligation; Interest repayment affect income statement and cash flow; Collateral is usually required by the bank and it can increase the length of time to break-even in a start-up venture (Herrington et al, 2008). Commercial bank finance model: According to Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt et al. (2006), the two primary sources of external finance for new small businesses are equity and debt. External equity in the form of venture capital or the stock exchange or bank credit facility is usually not available for new small businesses. Venture capitalists often enter the firm at the middle or later stages of its lifecycle. The lack of venture capital funds makes many new small businesses dependent on bank loans and overdrafts and suppliers\u2019 credit for early-stage financing, which is also known as unstructured lending (FinScope Survey, 2010).

Fifteen ARs that made landfall in the Spanish region of Galicia have been analyzed using the 2B-GEOPROF and 2C-PRECIP-COLUMN from the CloudSat cloud profiling radar (CPR). An estimation of the relative ratio between warm and cold precipitation associated with each event is provided. Broadly speaking, cold precipitation accounts for 80% of the total. This value is slightly higher than the already stated for Pacific AR events. However, similar mean rain rates (0.35 mm/h for the warm precipitation and 1.16 mm/h for the cold counterpart) to those reported by the literature have been obtained. In the absence of a more comprehensive and conclusive statistic, it seems that cold precipitation is predominant along the central axis of a well-developed AR. In this central core of the AR, the bulk of the moisture remains in the lower levels, and the freezing level (FL) is low. According to these results, the interaction between the warm conveyor and the cold conveyor belt may eventually raise the FL to upper levels, leading the warm fraction to play a more important \u2014even though still secondary\u2014 role.", "doi": "10.3390/ECAS2020-08119", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Pr\u00f3ba enzymatycznej transestryfikacji wybranych sacharyd\u00f3w", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Development of a New Approach to Estimate the In-mouth Release Characteristics of Odorants in Drinks", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.3136/nskkk.67.424", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of The Japanese Society for Food Science and Technology-nippon Shokuhin Kagaku Kogaku Kaishi", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Mixing and drying mud and ash at Tully Mill", "abstract": "Disposal of mud and ash, particularly in wet weather conditions, is a significant expense for mills.

That is to say, when a patient refuses treatment on the basis of beliefs that in no way reflect reality, clinicians and ethicists tend to agree that their refusal is not valid. During the COVID-19 pandemic, however, we have witnessed many patients refuse potentially life-saving interventions not based on delusion but on conspiracy beliefs. Importantly, many of the beliefs espoused by conspiracy theorists resemble delusions in a number of relevant ways. For instance, conspiracy beliefs often posit states of affairs that could not possibly exist in the world, they are recalcitrant in the face of disconfirming evidence, and they tend to put the believer in a state of paranoia. Given these similarities, how should we think about conspiracy theorists' capacity for making clinical decisions? In this paper, I attempt to answer this question by first offering an account of just what makes some set of beliefs count as a conspiracy theory. Second, I attempt to disambiguate conspiracy beliefs from delusions by exploring important conceptual and psychological features of both. Finally, I apply standard criteria for assessing a patient's decision-making capacity to instances of conspiracy beliefs and argue that, although the picture is muddy, there may be cases in which conspiracy beliefs undermine capacity. I end by exploring the implications that this might have for surrogate decision-making and addressing potential objections.", "doi": "10.1111/bioe.13146", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Bioethics", "venue": "Bioethics", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "When silence is golden Virtuous silence in the organisation: its conceptualisation, key characteristics, and values", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1504/ijbge.2023.129421", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "International Journal of Business Governance and Ethics", "venue": "International Journal of Business Governance and Ethics", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Peer Review, Open Access, and Other Publishing Scams", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of Information Ethics", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Show Code.", "abstract": "\"Let's get one thing straight: there is no such thing as a show code,\" my attending asserted, pausing for effect. \"You either try to resuscitate, or you don't.

Introduction In the US, the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) currently endorses 29 disorders for which newborns should be screened, given evidence of the benefits of early detection. With increasing knowledge of disease progression, new and improved treatment options, and development of efficient screening tests, the screening of newborns for lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) has been quickly gaining momentum in the last decade. In 2019, Nevada passed Senate Bill 291, mandating the screening of all conditions in the RUSP, including Pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I). Currently, improved screening technology can measure enzymatic activities for several LSDs in a single analysis, allowing for the conservation of labor, equipment, samples, and reagents. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of adding Fabry and Gaucher disease to Nevada\u2019s newborn screening panel once screening for Pompe disease and MPS I has been established. Methods We performed a systematic review of literature to identify evidence on the natural history of Fabry and GD, as well as availability and effectiveness of treatment options and screening tests. We also compiled a list of costs associated with common clinical manifestations of Fabry and GD that commonly occur prior to diagnosis without an early detection program. We then compared these costs to the estimated costs of screening. Results We have estimated that the cost of adding on the screening of these two LSDs, once screening for Pompe and MPS I is established, will cost approximately $89,205 per year. The estimated costs of management of Fabry and GD in the absence of early detection and treatment are shown below: 2021 American College of Legal Medicine JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE 2021, VOL. 41, NO.

The CPC/2011 only lays down certain evidentiary prohibitions in one general way. Therefore, the author analyzes relevant legal provisions aimed at protecting the right to privacy of citizens. First, photographs and recordings made by citizens must not result from a crime. The relevant offenses are unauthorized wiretapping and recording and unauthorized photographing. In support of the fact that photographs and recordings of someone committing a crime constitute admissible evidence, it is also reflected in the provision of the Public Information and Media Act which establishes derogations from the right to privacy if the person has attracted public attention through his public statements or behavior in private, family or professional life and thus gave rise to the publication of information or records. Second, in the case of photographs and recordings taken on security cameras installed to protect the security of people and property, which monitor public areas or facilities or premises that are privately owned and if the cameras are installed in accordance with the Private Security Act, we consider such recordings and photographs should be admissible evidence. Finally, we consider that the evidence obtained illegally by the court should be distinguished from the evidence obtained illegally by the citizens.

Our work assumes a sequential image segmentation procedure where regions are progressively segmented and recognized by associating them with corresponding nodes in graphs related to the prior knowledge. The main contribution concerns the parameterization of the k-means clustering algorithm, to be used during the segmentation procedure, and the graph-matching-based identification of resulting clusters, corresponding to regions declared in graphs. The parameterization of k-means is based on known relationships as well as on regions that have been segmented and recognized at previous steps. Parameters are the region of interest within which k-means clustering is constrained, the number of clusters, and seeding constraints. Photometric relationships built from resulting clusters are matched with a priori known relationships to identify each cluster, this being formulated as an exact graph-matching problem. The potential of this approach is studied in four use cases involving real gray-scale and color images with dedicated sequential analysis procedures. Processing results are compared with those obtained without the proposed parameterization of k-means, as well as with some other clustering approaches.

However, with the resurgence in drug tolerance among malaria parasites worldwide. The onus is on drug designers to synthesize more effective and less toxic drugs. In this study we sought to determine the effects of quinine, and the synthetic quinolines primaquine and chloroquine, on antioxidant enzymes so as to gain a better understanding of their effects on various enzyme systems which might be of value in the development of new, safe and more effective drugs. We used the Sprague-Dawley rat as a model to study the effects of these drugs on various hepatic and renal antioxidant enzymes. Our results show that primaquine administration increased the activities of some antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase), whereas chloroquine increased the activity of only superoxide dismutase while decreasing that of glutathione peroxidase and catalase. These results indicate a predisposition of the organs towards oxidative damage as evidenced by increases in parameters of lipid peroxidation in the same organs. Unlike the two synthetic drugs, however, quinine did not appear to cause any significant alterations in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes and neither did it cause any oxidative damage in rat organs. From these results, we conclude that since quinoline is still an effective drug against some chloroquine-resistant strains of malaria,the renewed interest in quinoline drugs should aim to design and synthesize quinine analogues which are less toxic and have enhanced antimalarial activity.", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "[Zonal types of host-parasite complexes of arthropods and small mammals in a flat part of Western Siberia].", "abstract": ": Within a flat part of Western Siberia distribution of the small mammals and parasitic arthropods connected with them is accompanied by formation zonal host-parasite complexes dated for corresponding landscape zones or subzones: tundra complex dated for a tundra zone; forest complex dated for a forest zone (including subzones northern taiga, middle taiga, southern taiga and subtaiga); forest-steppe complex dated for a northern forest-steppe subzone; steppe complex dated for a southern forest-steppe subzone and steppe.

Compact self-ballasted fluorescent lamps of red light (21 W), which have rich red light with a peak wavelength of 660 nm developed as a trial model, and incandescent lamps (75 W) as a control were used for light sources. The minimum photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) for the inhibition of flower bud initiation, resulting in normal spray flower formation, by irradiation with the compact self-ballasted fluorescent lamps of red light was smaller than that by irradiation with incandescent lamps under the same nightbreak time. In the autumn-flowering cultivar, the minimum PPFD for the inhibition of flower bud initiation was identified under 1-h night-break treatment with compact self-ballasted fluorescent lamps of red light, whereas no value was indicated with incandescent lamps. In the autumn-flowering and summer-to-autumn-flowering cultivars, as the product of the minimum PPFD and irradiation time was almost constant by irradiation with compact self-ballasted fluorescent lamps of red light, it is considered that the minimum PPFD is inversely related to the irradiation time on minimum fluence.

The results obtained make it possible to learn the history of the existence of the iconographic type of the Icon of the Iver Mother of God, to reveal its religious and cultural role, as well as to trace a number of historical events associated with the missionary activities of Patriarch Nikon in Mordovia, which is the scientific novelty of the publication.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion. The social significance of the study is determined by the focus on the preservation, restoration and popularization of cultural heritage objects as material evidence of historical events related to the development of the spiritual culture of the Mordovian people.

Whereas Handy et al (1988 Phys. Rev. Lett. 60 253) demonstrated the effectiveness of the {\\it Moment Problem} based, Eigenvalue Moment Method (EMM), for generating arbitrarily tight bounds to the multidimensional, positive, bosonic ground state, its extension to arbitrary excited states seemed intractable. We have discovered a new, moment representation based, quantization formalism that achieves this. Unlike EMM, no convex optimization methods are required. The entire formulation is algebraic. As a result of our preliminary investigation, we are able to match, or surpass, the excellent, but intricate, analysis of Kravchenko et al (1996 Phys. Rev. A 54 287) with respect to the quadratic Zeeman effect, for a broad range of magnetic field strengths. Unlike their analysis, the proposed method is simple, involves no truncations, and the projection of the quantum operator is exact, within each moment subspace. Our new approach, the Orthogonal Polynomial Projection Quantization-Bounding Method (OPPQ-BM), exploits the implicit bounding capabilities of a previous method developed by Handy and Vrinceanu (2013 J. of Phys. A: Math. Theor. 46 135202). What emerges is a completely new type of analysis (i.e. constrained quadratic form minimization) that validates the importance of moment equation representations for quantizing physical systems. Whereas the underlying principles of EMM guarantee it to be more efficient than OPPQ-BM, the ability to implement algebraic computations, as opposed to pursuing nonlinear convex optimization methods (which can be relaxed through linear programming alternatives) recommends OPPQ-BM.

Seismic reprocessing using the common reflection surface (CRS) stack technique allows revised interpretation of the structural setting and the evolution of salt plugs in the area of the Glueckstadt Graben, located near the center of the North German Basin (NGB). Reprocessing of seismic data also provides an alternative view of the geodynamic origin of the basin. Reprocessing of data clearly demonstrates the capabilities of the CRS technique to improve the quality of low-fold data. The images display a considerably improved signal-to-noise ratio and much more detail than the common midpoint processing (CMP) of the 1980s. Moreover, a velocity model consistent with the data was built and used to perform prestack and poststack depth migrations. The image of a Jurassic salt plug indicates tectonics similar to observations in the Allertal region at the northern fringe of the inverted Lower Saxony Basin, where overthrusting plays a major role in the evolution of salt structures. Consequently, shortening of the Mesozoic strata was included in the revised interpretation. The reprocessing also provided new insights into the petroleum systems in this area, indicating possible new exploration targets. The results may lead to a new geologic understanding of the area. Instead of a two-story salt plug, steep reverse faults and associated salt structures similar to the features along the Allertal lineament may best explain the investigated seismic line. Furthermore, CRS processing leads to a new view of the shape of the Moho in the center of the NGB. This view supports the assumption that the origin of the NGB may be more related to metamorphic processes during basin initiation than to crustal stretching.", "doi": "10.1306/13311429H43464", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "INTERVIEW WITH DEREK C.

This study investigated the effects of age, education, and cognitive impairment on TOMM Trial 2 performance in a first-generation, monolingual Spanish speaking, Latino sample.\n \n \n \n The sample consisted of 26 first-generation Latino adults, 14 women and 12 men, Mean age = 57.11 (SD = 11.99); Mean education = 7.69 years (SD = 4.14), who underwent outpatient neuropsychological evaluation that included administration of the TOMM. 4 with invalid performances were excluded. Of the remaining 26, 9 were cognitively intact and 17 met criteria for a neurocognitive disorder.\n \n \n \n A combined linear regression analysis showed that age, education, and cognitive impairment status did not account for a significant portion of the variance in TOMM Trial 2 scores (R2 = 1.70; p = .283). Similarly, analysis of variance (ANOVA) found no significant differences between impaired (M = 46.68; SD = 5.78) and unimpaired (M = 46.50; SD = 6.09) patients (p = .942).\n \n \n \n Results suggested that age, level of education, or cognitive impairment do not have a significant effect on TOMM Trial 2 performance in a sample of first-generation Latinos.\n", "doi": "10.1093/arclin/acz029.10", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology", "venue": "Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "The association between medical comorbidity and psychotherapy processes and outcomes for major depressive disorder in a community mental health setting.", "abstract": "Many individuals seeking mental health services for depression often suffer from a comorbid medical condition. The goal of the present study was to assess the presence of medical comorbidity in a community mental health center setting that primarily serves a Medicare and Medicaid population, characterize the types of comorbid medical conditions experienced in this setting, and explore the association between medical conditions on the alliance, attrition from services, and outcome. Medical diagnoses were collected from patient charts and structured clinical interviews from 353 participants who had a baseline assessment as part of a comparative effectiveness study of cognitive and dynamic therapies for major depressive disorder. We calculated the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the number of total medical diagnoses for each patient. Results from this study revealed that a high percentage of patients in this setting experienced a comorbid medical condition. No significant associations were found between the number of medical conditions or the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the alliance. No significant relationship was found between the number of medical conditions or the Charlson Comorbidity Index and early attrition from treatment or treatment outcome. However, exploratory analyses found that presence of a nervous system disorder was associated with relatively poorer treatment outcomes after initial engagement. Implications of these findings are discussed. Treatments for major depressive disorder may benefit from addressing the impact of medical disorders on physical functioning.

Assessing the uncertainty on the geometry of the reservoir is as important to the end result as assessing the uncertainty on rock properties. Geometric uncertainty modelling in surface-based models poses the challenge of maintaining geological consistency. To perturb structural models in a geologically consistent way the UVT-Transform is used. Geological objects such as faults and horizons are embedded in a meshed volume. A set of geochronological coordinates links the structural model to the property model, enabling coherent geometric uncertainty modelling without invalidating the property model. Effects of different sources of uncertainty (e.g. the velocity model, fault position, horizon position and geometry, etc.) are applied successively to a reference model. Fault to fault and horizon to fault contacts are always consistent because of the way the structural model is defined. Additional constraints on the simulations ensure that the model is valid and that the horizons do not intersect.

With the onset of climate change and human exploitation of our environment, there are \nnow serious concerns over the sustainability of water resources in this basin with 6 million m3 consumed every \nday for public water supply alone. \n \nGroundwater in the Thames basin is extremely important, providing 40% of water for public supply. The \nprincipal aquifer is the Chalk, a dual permeability limestone, which has been extensively studied to understand \nits hydraulic properties. The fractured Jurassic limestone in the upper catchment also forms an important aquifer, \nsupporting base\ufb02ow downstream during periods of drought.

This necessitates the simulation of the feedbacks and complex interactions \nbetween different parts of the water cycle, and the development of integrated environmental models. \n \nThe Open Modelling Interface (OpenMI) standard provides a method through which environmental models \nof varying complexity and structure can be linked, allowing them to run simultaneously and exchange data at \neach timestep.

In this study, we aimed to determine individual associations of known risk loci with clinical features of patients in the SIBDCS, as well as their combined effect on clinical outcomes.\n \n \n \n Based on 158 analysed SNPs, we investigated the numerical distribution of risk alleles and determined an individual SNP risk score (defined as percentage of risk alleles; i.e. number of risk alleles divided by twice the number of given SNPs multiplied with 100). We then performed linear regression modelling to investigate, whether relevant clinical disease characteristics associate with this SNP risk score. Further, for each given clinical outcome, a model was run with all SNPs as potential predictors, and the number of significant associations per SNP counted.\n \n \n \n In a total of 2304 genotyped patients, we observed a median number of risk alleles of 167, 168 and 167 for IBD overall, CD and UC/IC, respectively with a narrow inter quartile range [11 (q25 = 162, q75 = 173) for IBD and CD; 12 (q25 = 161, q75 = 173) for UC/IC].

A cut-off concentration of C4 of 48.4 ng/ml or higher identified patients with MC and IBD with diarrhoea attributable to BAM with an AUROC 0.89 and sensitivity 79.8%, specificity 90.9%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 96.1% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 88.6% compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). IBD patients in remission (FC < 100 \u00b5g/g) with up to 4 bowel movements daily was n = 16 (76.2%) and concentration of C4 above 48.4 ng/ml were found in n = 13 (61%) of the patients.\n \n \n \n BAM in IBD and MC is a common and very under-diagnosed condition. Serum C4 could be used for screening biomarker for BAM in patients with IBD, IBD after surgery (ileal resection) and MC. We found that serum concentrations of C4 above 48.4 ng/ml identify patients with diarrhoea likely attributable to BAM with high diagnostic accuracy and IBD patients in remission with found bile acid diarrhoea can benefit from additional treatment with bile acid binders. Further bigger studies are needed to establish the efficacy of serum C4 in patients with suspected BAM in IBD and MC.\n", "doi": "10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjz203.346", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of Crohns & Colitis", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Learning from a Trailblazer in Dermatology", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine", "venue": "The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "OP40 A core transferable microbiota in responders to faecal microbiota transplant for ulcerative colitis shape mucosal T-cell immunity", "abstract": "\n \n \n Biologic therapy has significantly improved treatment for UC, but nearly two-thirds of patients attenuate the response. Additional therapeutic modalities are therefore needed to address the underlying pathophysiology of UC. Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is an emerging therapy for the treatment of UC, but several randomised controlled trials have shown variable efficacy of FMT, and the microbial mechanisms responsible for clinical response are not well understood. Therefore, using samples from our pilot FMT study (Jacob, V, et al. Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2017), we aim to identify the core transferable microbiota (CTM) in UC patients responsive to FMT therapy and to define the therapeutic mechanism of these strains in pre-clinical models.\n \n \n \n IBD disease activity scores were used to define a clinical response. Metagenomic sequencing of a donor, recipient, and 4-week post-FMT faecal samples was performed to define the CTM. Strain-level transferability was defined using the StrainFinder algorithm. To define the transferable immune-reactive microbiota (TIM), IgA-seq was performed on a donor, recipient, and 4-week post-FMT faecal samples. TIM strains were isolated from faecal samples and gnotobiotic mouse models were used to evaluate their impact on mucosal immunity and mouse models of colitis.\n \n \n \n Here, we defined a CTM associated with clinical response to FMT for UC. Strain-level tracking of the CTM confirmed that clinical response correlated with strain transferability. In addition, we defined a core TIM by IgA-seq that correlated with clinical response. In humanised mouse models, these TIM were found to induce IgA in a T-cell independent manner. Colonisation of germ-free mice with a core TIM strain of Odoribacter induced IL-10-dependent, RORgt+/Foxp3+ iTreg cells and reduced the severity of transfer T-cell colitis in mono-colonised RAG\u2212/\u2212 mice.\n \n \n \n Our data highlight an immune-reactive, core transferable microbiota in responders to FMT for UC. Using pre-clinical mouse models of colitis, we define the mechanistic impact of these TIM in shaping mucosal immunity and guiding the response to UC.

Mainly because of their trophic properties, there is mounting interest in the therapeutic potential of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The aim of the study was to test the potential of the secreted molecules derived from a distinct population of second trimester amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, termed as human spindle-shaped mesenchymal stem cells (SS-AF-MSCs), as a novel approach for IBD MSC-based therapy. Methods: Colitis was induced in approximately 8-week-old NOD/ SCID mice by daily oral administration of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) (3% w/v in tap water) for 5 days. The colitis evolution was evaluated by daily monitoring of body weight, stool consistency, and bleeding. Conditioned media (CM) derived from ss-AF-MSCs cells were collected, concentrated, and then delivered intraperitoneally. Histopathological analysis was performed, and inflammatory cytokine levels were determined Results: Administration of CM derived from ss-AF-MSCs cells reduced the severity of colitis in mice. TGFb1 protein levels were increased in the mice received CM, whereas TNFa and MMP2 protein levels were decreased. Accordingly, IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) mRNA levels were significantly increased in mice that received CM, whereas TNFa and IL-1b mRNA levels were decreased.

The terminal ileum is affected in the majority of genetic animal models of CD as well. Additionally, CD recurs at sites of tight anastomosis or strictures postoperatively. These observations lead to the assumption that increased intraluminal pressure related to the presence of a valve, sphincter or stenosis is associated with CD pathogenesis. We investigated the hypothesis that the creation of a partial intestinal stenosis could have an impact on disease severity, in a genetic animal model of CD (TNF\u0394are/+). TNF\u0394are/+ mice overexpress TNF\u03b1 leading to a Crohn-like colitis in the terminal ileum.\n \n \n \n Twenty-nine TNF\u0394are/+ mice, 6 weeks old, were divided into three intervention groups: stenosis, sham and control. In the stenosis group (n = 11), a partial small bowel obstruction was created via a novel triple suture technique, approximately 3 cm from the ileocecal valve. In the control group (n = 9), a loose single suture was placed at the aforementioned site to test the direct effect of the foreign material on the intestinal wall. The sham group (n = 9) received a sham operation. The triple suture stenosis was also performed on wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice (group WT, n = 9). 6 weeks post-surgery all animals were sacrificed and samples from the ileum 3 cm proximal and 3 cm distal to the intervention site were collected for histopathological evaluation. The Crohn-like changes were assessed using a modified colitis histological scoring system (based on Katakura et al., JCI 2005; 115: 695\u2013702).\n \n \n \n Proximal to the intervention, the mean colitis score of stenosis group (10.18 \u00b1 0.87) was significantly higher compared with sham (6.33 \u00b1 0.97, p: 0.009) and control group (5.00 \u00b1 0.91, p: 0.001). There was no difference between sham and control group (p: 0.332). No significant differences between the groups were reported distal to the intervention. The triple suture technique led to Crohn-like inflammatory lesions only in the TNF\u0394are/+ mice, as shown from the significantly increased score compared with WT mice proximal and distal to the stenosis (10.18 \u00b1 0.87 vs. 0.67 \u00b1 0.37, p < 0.001 and 9.20 \u00b1 1.09 vs. 0.33 \u00b1 0.24, p < 0.001).\n \n \n \n \n The creation of a stenotic segment in the intestine of TNF\u0394are/+ mice, led to higher colitis score than expected. The probable mechanism is the increased intraluminal pressure proximal to the stenosis. This suggests that mechanical forces contribute as important co-factors in the pathophysiology of CD, in genetically predisposed populations.\n", "doi": "10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjz203.183", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of Crohns & Colitis", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "730 MANAGEMENT OF WALLED OFF PANCREATIC NECROSIS WITH NASOCYSTIC IRRIGATION VERSUS LUMEN APPOSING METAL STENT (LAMS) - RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.gie.2020.03.594", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Gastrointestinal Endoscopy", "venue": "Gastrointestinal Endoscopy", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}], "statistics & probability": [{"title": "Conditional Hypothesis Testing", "abstract": "When testing multiple hypotheses, conventional techniques used for reducing false positives require all tests to be pre-specified and do not account for correlation between p-values.

The case of a two-dimensional domain poses both statistical and computational challenges, which are typically alleviated by assuming separability. However, separability is often questionable, sometimes even demonstrably inadequate. We propose a framework for the analysis of covariance operators of random surfaces that generalizes separability, while retaining its major advantages. Our approach is based on the expansion of the covariance into a series of separable terms. The expansion is valid for any covariance over a two-dimensional domain. Leveraging the key notion of the partial inner product, we generalize the power iteration method to general Hilbert spaces and show how the aforementioned expansion can be efficiently constructed in practice at the level of the surface observations. Truncation of the expansion and retention of the leading terms automatically induces a nonparametric estimator of the covariance, whose parsimony is dictated by the truncation level. The resulting estimator can be calculated, stored and manipulated with little computational overhead relative to separability. Consistency and rates of convergence are derived under mild regularity assumptions, illustrating the trade-off between bias and variance regulated by the truncation level.

If a function fails to satisfy these requirements, then we must often apply a Monte Carlo method to obtain the approximation ( Jan Scigulinsk\u00fd , 2012 ) . Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulation offers an analyst a greater degree of flexibility to dictate his simulation conditions and sampling plans than does an experimenter in a real world environment (E. J. McGrath and D. C. Irving, 1975). The main objective of the study was to test the overall accuracy of Crude Monte Carlo method for evaluating the definite integrals of common functions having different dimensions. To realize this goal, softwares such as MATLAB version 2011, FORTRAN 90/95 and EXCEL 2010 were used. Functions that can be integrated both numerically and analytically were selected so as to compare the results and test the accuracy of the methods. For evaluating the integrals, random numbers were generated between 0 and 1 by typing the \u2018rand\u2019 function on the command window of MATLAB version 2011 and also by running the computer program written with FORTRAN 90/95. The integration of too complicated functions was performed numerically using the adaptive Simpson\u2019s Quadrature and results were considered as exact values. To measure the magnitude of the error in the method, the variance of the mesh points were calculated and then compared with the true absolute errors.The results revealed that the overall accuracy of the method is good for one dimensional integration and the accuracy declines as the dimension increases in contrast to some of the literature. Moreover, the accuracy did not necessarily decline as the number of mesh points increased. The variances of the mesh points were found to overestimate the true absolute errors. Theoretical errors were calculated to be greater than the true absolute errors and less than the variances. It can be concluded that one can use Crude Monte Carlo method to estimate the integral of one dimensional complicated functions with known confidence intervals for the true values.

Continuous monitoring of levels of air pollutants affecting air quality, human health and the ecosystem is essentially required on a day-to-day basis. The influence of pollutants on the air quality, human health and susceptibility of plants is studied widely with the help of various indices, e.g. air-quality index (AQI), air-quality health index (AQHI), air-pollution index (API), air-pollution tolerance index (APTI) and anticipated performance index. In this chapter, we discuss the important indices: AQI, AQHI, API and APTI. As a case study, we have discussed in detail the AQI. We report on the status of ambient air quality (for the year 2016) over the IGP, utilizing the CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board, India) database. Air quality index (AQI) values have been presented systematically in this chapter to better evaluate the air quality associated with various major and potential atmospheric pollutants (available in CPCB database). Ambient data of air pollutants (PM2.5 or PM10, SO2, NO, NO2 and CO) have been retrieved from three sites continuously monitored by CPCB: upwind (Panchkula; states of Haryana), central (Lucknow; states of Uttar Pradesh) and downwind locations (Kolkata; West Bengal) in the IGP. Monthly and seasonally averaged data sets have been discussed and compared for the aforementioned three sites. Results suggest that Lucknow (in central IGP) was more polluted than the Kolkata and Panchkula sites (upwind of major polluting sources in the IGP). Relative to Lucknow, low concentrations of air pollutants at Kolkata suggests the influence of sea- and land-breeze wind systems on ventilation coefficient and efficient dispersion of the pollutants. AQI values at Kolkata ranging between 27 and 137 indicate a good to moderately polluted atmospheric scenario. However, AQI at Lucknow ranging between 301 and 400 indicates very poor air quality, particularly during post-monsoon and wintertime, whereas at Panchkula during most of the time, air quality was found to be satisfactory (AQI: 51-100).

His ideas reel back on themselves; his language bounces with ambiguous precision; his stage-craft explodes with designs to be both confusing and clarifying. He\u2019s a boulevard playwright with revolutionary sentiments. In short, there is nothing easy about Tom Stoppard. But Hermione Lee works with a deluge of archival data and interviews with friends, colleagues, critics, and Stoppard himself while herself maintaining a distance that allows her to applaud the strengths while noting the weaknesses of this man and his works. In the end, we have a portrait of a man and artist many of us would favourably recognize. Lee brings considerable skill to this task, having written biographies of Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, and Philip Roth, among others. Her distinguished academic career has been a blend of astute biographic and literary criticism, a combination, she claims, that can\u2019t occur one without another. Tom Stoppard: A Life has tested her skills, spanning several years of very close contact with Stoppard, who invited Lee to write the biography in 2013. This is from a man whose characters have more than occasionally observed, \u201cBiography is the worst possible excuse for getting people wrong\u201d (Indian Ink 5) and \u201cbiography is the mesh through which our real life escapes\u201d (The Invention of Love 93). Add to this the fact that Stoppard\u2019s entire canon argues that we live in a world \u201cwhen almost everything you thought you knew was wrong\u201d (Arcadia 69). So in addition to the standard biographical task of trying to reveal the privacies of a very public persona, Lee is faced with the even more daunting task of revealing a subject who isn\u2019t entirely sure it\u2019s possible to unearth \u201cthe real thing,\u201d regardless of how verbally and intellectually dexterous one may be. Lee packs nearly 900 pages with facts about Stoppard\u2019s life and work, moulded in a manner that accepts uncertainty as the very cornerstone of her enterprise. Given that Stoppard is in his eighties (born 1937) and that he is still quite active (having produced Leopoldstadt in 2020), Lee has had access to a large proportion of Stoppard\u2019s life and work.

Objectives It is quite important to calculate and present the patients' exposure to clinically important potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs). We aimed to investigate the pDDIs and the burden of polypharmacy in COVID-19. Methods The medical records of 126 consecutive inpatients with COVID-19 treatment were retrospectively analyzed. The Lexi-interact database was used to investigate pDDIs. Results According to the Lexi-interact database, 605 pDDIs were detected. Of these pDDIs, 23 (3.8%) were A risk category interaction, 186 (30.7%) were B risk category interaction, 339 (56%) were C risk category interaction, 54 (8.9%) were D risk category interaction, and 3 (0.5%) were X risk category interaction. Sixty-five-point five percent of pDDIs (n=396) were clinically important pDDIs (C, D, and X categories), and 69 patients (54.8%) had at least one clinically important pDDIs. The most interacting drug was hydroxychloroquine (n=171, 28.3%). Hydroxychloroquine was also the most interacting drug in the C risk category (n=101, 29.8%) and had 19 pDDIs with metformin, 16 pDDIs with beta-blockers, 13 pDDIs with acetylsalicylic acid, and 10 pDDIs with insulin in the C risk category. Enoxaparin was the most interacting drug (n=25, 46.3%) in the D risk category and most of them were with acetylsalicylic acid (n=12). The most common possible clinical manifestations of pDDIs were QT prolongation, hypoglycemia, and hemorrhage. One hundred and eighteen patients (93.6%) used five or more drugs daily. There was a significant positive correlation between the number of drugs prescribed to patients and the number of clinically important pDDIs (r=0.80, p<0.001).

The appraisal opinions of a total of 47 cases were changed. Seven of them did not meet the disability criteria, and the main reason was that there was no clear history of coma and no head injury was admitted; the coma history of the 40 other cases had to be confirmed by the court before they can be clearly identified as disabilities.

The role of emotions in wise reasoning is not well understood. On the one hand, work on emotional regulation suggests that downregulating intense emotions may lead to wiser reasoning. On the other hand, emerging work suggests that recognizing and balancing emotions provides critical insights into life experiences, suggesting an alternative path to wiser reasoning. We present a series of observational, diary, and experimental studies (N = 3,678 participants) addressing these possibilities, examining how wisdom-related characteristics of reasoning-epistemic humility, recognition of a world in flux, self-transcendence, recognition of diverse perspectives on an issue, and search for integration of diverse perspectives/compromise-relate to emotional intensity and to emodiversity (i.e., emotional richness and evenness) in a given situation. Across 5 studies, testing wisdom nominees and examining individual differences and manipulated wise reasoning, wisdom-related characteristics appeared in conjunction with emodiversity, independent of downregulated emotional intensity. The positive association between emodiversity and wisdom-related characteristics occurred consistently for daily challenges, unresolved interpersonal conflicts, as well as political conflicts. The relationship between emotional intensity and wisdom-related characteristics was less systematic, with some studies showing a positive (rather than negative) association between emotional intensity and wisdom. Together, these results demonstrate that wise reasoning does not necessarily require uniform emotional downregulation. Instead, wise reasoning can also benefit from a rich and balanced emotional life.

Theoretical accounts of this attentional boost effect (ABE) have emphasized the role of target detection, yet it is unclear whether the ABE originates from target detection or response. To examine this, we asked participants to search for the letter T among a rapid stream of other letters while encoding objects to memory. The nontarget letters, drawn randomly from the remaining letters of the Roman alphabet, comprised half of the trials. Across three experiments, participants responded only to the target letter T, to all letters but the target letter T, or to both T and not-T with two different keys. The large number of different nontargets ensured that participants preferred to search for the target letter T regardless of the response requirement. We found an ABE when participants responded to the target letter T, but not when they responded to the other nontarget letters, suggesting that response requirement modulated the ABE. Furthermore, making different responses to targets and nontargets led to a memory advantage for target-paired objects. Thus, target detection and response both contributed to the ABE.

Separable dimensions are easy to attend in isolation, while integral dimensions are not. Little et al. (2016) showed that when trial-by-trial responses are analyzed, a consistent pattern of sequential effects was found in a modified Garner paradigm using integral-dimension stimuli. The present experiments investigated whether these pronounced sequential effects are also found with separable-dimension stimuli. Four experiments using two different types of separable dimensions were conducted. The results indicated that similar patterns of sequential effects were present for separable-dimension stimuli, but, unlike for integral dimensions, the effect of a change in the irrelevant dimension in the filtering task was not found. Further, for separable dimensions, the overall pattern of sequential effects did not vary between the Garner tasks (i.e., control, correlated, and filtering). To explain these results, we fit a sequence-sensitive exemplar model and compared the fits of this model to a novel sequence-sensitive feature model, in which only the relevant feature influences the categorization decision. We found that the full exemplar model provided a more compelling account of both our separable dimension data and the integral dimension data of Little et al. (2016). These findings provide a more complete understanding of perceptual categorization and add to the growing body of literature on the prevalence and critical implications of strong sequential effects in cognitive tasks.

Viewers wanting to learn efficiently can play these videos at faster-than-normal speeds, a feature offered by hosting services such as YouTube. Although previous research suggests that moderate speeding may not lessen learning, little research has tested this form of media for speeding-induced learning impairments. Further, even if learning is not impaired by speeding, the degree to which users find speed increases taxing and/or unpleasant is unknown. We therefore created a set of screen-captured instructional videos and tested whether speeding them by up to 250% affected learning, perceived workload, and preferences. Speed increases of up to 200% minimally affected learning, but even modest 150% speed increases substantially increased perceived workload and reduced viewer preferences. However, we were able to create videos that were more selectively speeded by concentrating speeding on pauses and relatively unimportant and slow speech. These videos were just as time efficient as the 150% speeded videos, but viewers preferred them. Our findings demonstrate that speeded instructional videos have the potential to facilitate efficient learning, and they suggest techniques such as selective speeding that may be used to support efficiency while lessening viewer preference costs.

While mechanistic studies of the folding process in vitro have been conducted for only a small number of membrane proteins, the available evidence indicates that their folding process is thermodynamically driven like that of soluble proteins. In vivo, however, the majority of integral membrane proteins are installed in membranes by dedicated machinery, suggesting that the cellular systems may act to facilitate and regulate the spontaneous physical process of folding. Both the in vitro folding process and the in vivo pathway must navigate an energy landscape dominated by the energetically favorable burial of hydrophobic segments in the membrane interior and the opposition to folding due to the need for passage of polar segments across the membrane.

The model is used to\u00a0compare\u00a0the folding time under conditions which depict both the in vitro and in vivo pathways.

First, too much computational cost is used, the computational cost of mapped WENO method is around [Formula: see text] of the original WENO method. Second, on the nonuniform meshes, too much memory space is used. We can take the WENO-RM method on nonuniform rectangle meshes for example, which is one of the famous mapped WENO methods. Comparing to original WENO method, the WENO-RM needs to store [Formula: see text] additional parameters, where [Formula: see text] is the cell number.

The new strategy has following major advantages: first, it can give the solution which is as accurate as the original mapped WENO method; second, it can save the computational cost, because it only uses slightly more computational cost than the original WENO method; third, it can save the memory space because it only needs to store a little additional parameter compared to the original WENO method.", "doi": "10.1142/S012918312150145X", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "International Journal of Modern Physics C", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Wind Turbine Wakes: an actuator line approach", "abstract": "A new method for the calculation of the blade loads using the blade element theory is proposed: the \"effective velocity\" model proposes a correlation between the local flow around the airfoil and the undisturbed reference flow. This allows for the correct modeling of the interaction of the blades with the turbulent structures of the flow and the wake of an upstream wind turbine. The method is computationally cheap and the wind turbine performance prediction matches well the more validated BEM method. A comparison with the data measured on a 2 m rotor diameter wind turbine scaled model [2] placed in a wind tunnel is proposed. The aim of the work is to develop a method that is valid for wind turbine flows, validate the results against scaled model experimental data using the scaled model characteristics and use the validated code to predict the performance of large scale wind turbines. Current evaluations of wind turbine performance rely on revised versions of original BEM theory. The interaction between wind turbine wakes is not possible with these methods, while CFD is a promising tool in this field. Actual actuator line methods need to be improved in order to correctly model the interaction of modern large scale rotors with atmospheric and wake turbulence. The increase in rotor sizes increases the energy harvesting, but increases accordingly also the stress and the load that is suffered by all the components of a wind turbine. It is of fundamental importance to be able to reproduce correctly the interaction between the incoming flow and the rotor blades, since this is the way the loads on the wind turbine are generated. Many studies are devoted to this issue, mainly using the standard approach, that implies the use of the Blade Element theory, and applying the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory for the calculation of the thrust and torque generated by the rotor. This method is reliable when dealing with uniform flow, ideal rotors and all the assumptions that at the basis of this method [1].", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Mitigation strategy of cascading failures in urban traffic congestion based on complex networks", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1142/s0129183123500225", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "International Journal of Modern Physics C", "venue": "International Journal of Modern Physics C", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}], "logistics & transportation": [{"title": "Controller Architecture for the Autonomous Cars : MadeInGermany and eInstein", "abstract": "In this paper a realtime controller architecture for our autonomous cars, a highly equipped conventional car and an electric vehicle is presented. The key aspects for controlling a car are stability, accuracy and smoothness, which constrain design critereas of all kinds on controller components. This report presents solutions for a variety of controller components, and aspects of a controller implementation of an autonomous car. The algorithms described proved their applicability in dense urban Berlin traffic as well as on the Berlin Autobahn. 1 Car Introduction In our project AutoNOMOS we use three different platforms. The Spirit Of Berlin, a Dodge Caravan marks the first autonomous car which was programmed at the Artificial Intelligence Group of Prof. Ra\u00fal Rojas at the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin since 2006. This car successfully participated in the Darpa Urban Challenge and qualified for the semi finals. Since 2010 we are working on a Volkswagen Passat, called \u201cMadeInGermany\u201d (MiG). MiG is a very modern car with modern sensors and a drive by wire architecture where we have access to throttle and brake actorics via CAN bus. Since 2011 we are also working on an electric vehicle, a Mitsubishi iMiev, called \u201ce-Instein\u201d. Fig. 1. Autonomous Cars (f.l.t.r.): Spirit of Berlin, e-Instein, MadeInGermany 2 Controller Specification At the beginning of the development of a controller, one has to think about the environment the controller should work in and about the constraints the controller has to satisfy. For our autonomous cars, the following specification aspects were defined: \u2013 Safety: The controller must be fail safe on a high level with regards to software or hardware failures. Further, the controller must never perform maneuvers, which are not safe with respect to the physical limitations of the car or the environment. It must never operate beyond the mechanical limitations of the actoric. To give an example, a controller which operates on a flat street can to make other assumptions about grip in comparison to a controller which has to operate in off-road scenarios. Regarding actoric, a quickly responding and precisely adjustable actoric allows more aggressive maneuvers than the one reacting with huge time delays. As a rule of thumb translational and centrifugal forces are limited to 40 percent of physically possible values. \u2013 Accuracy: Reaching desired control values quickly is most important for a safe driving of the car. Imprecise or slow controllers usually lead to oscillations within the upper controller level or behavior layer. Oscillations are one reason for an uncomfortable driving experience. For MadeInGermany, the goal was to have a lateral error to the planned trajectory of less than 10 cm at 100 km/h and a velocity error of less than 0.5 km/h. \u2013 Comfort: Besides limiting the amount of lateral and longitudinal forces to a level which feels comfortable to a modest driver, another important aspect is to limit acceleration changes, i.e., the function of the acceleration vector over time must be continuous. Changes within the acceleration vector must remain small for a comfortable feeling of drive. Some of these aspects contradict each other, e.g., safety and comfort. A safe controller might try to apply appropriate maneuvers as fast as possible but this can be uncomfortable, because humans prefer slow changes of accelerations. Further, comfortable maneuvers, e.g., braking late, can sometimes result in dangerous situations. The same holds for accuracy. A controller which tries to be too precise can result in an uncomfortable feeling of drive. 3 Controller and Planning Modules Overview This section introduces the module chain and the corresponding module function description. Modules will be distinguished by their level of abstraction in terms of the platform on which they run. An overview of the given modules, their input parameters and their implementation name within the OROCOS-Framework are given in Fig. 2. The code within the AutoNOMOS project was designed to serve as a middle ware for a variety of autonomous platforms. Therefore, reusability of code was a very important aspect. Only the low controller modules are platform specific, high level behavior modules are independent of the platform they are executed on.", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Performance Measure for Transportation Network: A Study in Travel Time Dynamics", "abstract": "PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR TRANSPORTATION NETWORK: A STUDY IN TRAVEL TIME DYNAMICS by Anuj Nayyar \u3008Pushkin Kachroo\u3009, Examination Committee Chair Professor of Electrical Engineering University of Nevada, Las Vegas Arterial Performance Measurement and Monitoring is one of the leading goals of any transportation agency.

State DOTs typically develop cost indexes at the construction program level. There is little information available on developing cost indexes for bridge types. This paper outlines how such a bridge-level cost index can be developed. The bridge-level cost index was developed from 19 weighted bid items aggregated into four weighted components (groups) of bid items, and then aggregated to the weighted bridge system. Using publicly available data from Ohio DOT, on historical bid items, chained Fisher indexes were developed for typical Ohio DOT structural steel girder bridges. In addition, forecasting beyond 2021 was computed using a well-fitted regression model. The findings from this research could help Ohio DOT to accurately estimate the cost to construct structural steel girder bridges based on price changes and price trends. In addition, the result of this research allows for long-term planning and budgeting of costs for similar bridge types within the state of Ohio. In their simplest form, the cost indexes generated from this research will help paint a picture of changes in the cost of construction from one specific year to another at a granular level. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by offering detailed steps on how to develop construction cost indexes at a granular level and specifically for structural steel girder bridges.", "doi": "10.1177/03611981221143110", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Transportation Research Record", "venue": "Transportation Research Record", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Trajectory Prediction at Unsignalized Intersections using Social Conditional Generative Adversarial Network", "abstract": "Proactive and defensive driving requires the vehicle drivers, either human beings or software, to predict the intention of surrounding objects so as to prevent accidents.

Writing \u201cPassing the Baton\u201d brings to mind years of conversations with authors as we have negotiated the relationship between serious research and good writing. Sometimes imagining the readers draws out a fresh articulation, something that transcends the first achievement of a strong thesis. When that happens T&C\u2019s core mission comes to life as a forum wherein scholars from many perspectives educate one another and one another\u2019s core readers about questions of compelling interest. This same kind of conversation happens in T&C\u2019s essays and reviews. When thoughtful people stretch to imagine the wide world of T&C\u2019s readership, sometimes magical things happen. The intersection between research and writing in a scholar\u2019s work got me thinking of how the same tension works for an editor. The editor is ultimately responsible for all the work that ensures quality on every page.

For this reason, investing in war theory and strategy education for potential Strategic Soldiers is imperative for a 21st century military.

My own first encounter with Raymond Williams\u2019 writing occurred when Culture and Society 1780\u20131950 (1961 [1958]) was prescribed as required reading in my first year English Literature course at the University of Sydney in 1965. The Department of English at Sydney was just entering some years of bitter division which were to result in students being required to choose between two, structurally parallel but ideologically opposed, streams: one (the \u2018A course\u2019) taking a Leavisite approach to literary studies, and the other (the \u2018B course\u2019) working within a more conservative tradition of literary historiography. In 1965, the Leavisites were in the ascendancy, led by Professor Samuel Goldberg and a staff which included several of Leavis\u2019s former students from Cambridge \u2013 among them Howard Jacobson. The English 1 (A) course was a full-year program of overwhelmingly British texts (I recall that there was only one Australian novel) framed around the canon preferred by Leavis and his Scrutiny colleagues: novelists from Leavis\u2019s \u2018great tradition\u2019, the metaphysical, Augustan and Romantic poets, and Shakespeare. Historical, cultural and critical context was provided by Williams\u2019 Culture and Society and by Richard Hoggart\u2019s (1958) The Uses of Literacy. Given that the fissure in the department was related to the culture and civilization debates that had peaked in the United Kingdom more than a decade earlier, these were surprisingly contemporary and adventurous choices \u2013 although it has to be said that, for the most part, they were deployed in a relatively uncontroversial manner within the tutorials. Most often Culture and Society simply provided historical background to the analysis of the literary texts, but occasionally, it was used more interestingly, in conjunction with The Uses of Literacy, as a means of exploring the literary/moral concept of value and discussing the British debates around the definition of culture. For me, however, Williams\u2019 work exerted an influence that went well beyond what might have been intended by those designing the curriculum.

Leveraging such knowledge requires easy access to information so technical teams can readily tailor and use these best practices to avoid pitfalls and rework, thereby improving the system development process and its output\u2014the system of interest. The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) provides a wealth of reviewed and refined Systems Engineering best practices, lessons learned, and methods that can be used for this very purpose. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of INCOSE\u2019s resources and how one can leverage them to aid in complex system development to ultimately improve system performance. INTRODUCTION This paper provides an overview of how to leverage Systems Engineering (SE) best practices made available by the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE). Although there is no \u201csilver bullet\u201d or \u201cone way solves all\u201d SE process or \u201cwave a magic wand\u201d SE tool, SE lessons learned and published information can assist teams in managing the complexity of technical programs today. In fact, there is a wealth of SE information available from INCOSE through its numerous resources. These resources include but are not limited to iPub to search INCOSE\u2019s International Symposium publications, articles published in INCOSE\u2019s Systems Engineering journal, the INSIGHT publication, INCOSE Technical Products and Working Groups, and the INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook. An overview of how one can access and use these resources to quickly zero in on best practices and related information that the Systems Engineer can tailor for his or her specific program needs will be presented. Furthermore, this paper outlines the advantages of starting with a high-quality knowledge baseline through the use of these resources. The ultimate goal of this paper will be to add these available resources to the Systems Engineer\u2019s toolkit as an aid to improve overall technical performance of systems and programs. Readers will gain clear understanding of how to take advantage of decades of lessons learned and related best practices from the SE community provided via INCOSE. THE CAVEAT AND POWER OF BEST PRACTICES The term \u201cbest practice\u201d is often used quite loosely. It\u2019s an abstract term that could be appliced to policies, standards, processes, procedures, tools, or design, build, or test methods. It might relate to when one activity is performed in relation to another, or the level of detail required, or the quality methods employed, and so forth. Wikipedia.com provided the two following definitions: 1 A best practice is a technique, method, process, activity, incentive, or reward that is believed to be more effective at delivering a particular outcome than any other technique, method, process, etc. when applied to a particular condition or circumstance. Best practices can also be defined as the most efficient (least amount of effort) and effective (best results) way of accomplishing a task, based on repeatable procedures that have proven themselves over time for large numbers of people. There really is no end to what a \u201cbest practice\u201d could encompass, which is especially true within the discliple of Proceedings of the 2009 Ground Vehicle Systems Engineering and Technology Symposium (GVSETS) Leveraging INCOSE Resources To Identify Systems Engineering Best Practices \u2013 Peterson, Troy Page 2 of 8 Systems Engineering, which has a very comprehensive scope. Further complicating the application of best practices is the increasing dynamics of systems\u2019 use context which is making development activities more complicated and complex and often not very repeatable at a detailed level. Systems Engineers and Systems Engineering teams now often need to rely more on generalizations, heuristics, and principles from which to tailor program specific plans to remain adaptive and flexible to move with the necessary precision and speed on an individual program given its unique requirements. Nonetheless, one assertion many relate to is that engineers and development teams desire to eliminate rework, reduce risk and optimize systems and the work required to successfully deliver them. Within this paper the use of the term \u201cbest practice\u201d is focused on any technique, method, practice, process, activity, or piece of information that can be used to the benefit of an organization involved in systems development (from concept to disposal). This benefit can be realized via either increased effectiveness or efficiency in the process of system development and/or an improvement in system performance. For SE within the Department of Defense (DoD) there has been a recent convergence of SE terminology through reference to a common industry standard. More specifically the most recent Defense Acquisition Guidebook Systems Engineering process terminology is now aligned with ISO/IEC 15288:2008 which outlines standard system lifecycle processes. This is the same standard which the INCOSE handbook is aligned to, and it allows for common semantics between INCOSE products and DoD training offered though the Defense Acquisition University (DAU). This commonality allows for and enables an easier categorization and translation of best practices. However, while this aids the translation and sharing of best practices across programs and sectors, a practice that works in one context (program, sector or industry) may or may not work in another. Therein lies the danger in the term \u201cbest practice.\u201d Depending on the level of detail within the best practice it may only be a \u201cbest\u201d practice within the context it was developed and applied. As such, a best practice used within a different context could actually do more damage than good. This goes to the axiom expressed by Albert Einstein: \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.\u201d To simplify and improve the system development process, we desire to leverage best practices, but often the application of best practices is not as simple as a \u201ccopy and paste\u201d of a detailed process or adherance to an abstract intenational standard. The integration and application of SE best practices requires a knowledgable and experienced Systems Engineer to properly tailor the \u201cpractice\u201d for useful application to improve organizational, program or system performance. With this caveat in mind, we need both quality lessons learned and the experience and knowledge to apply them wisely. It has also been shown that the application of best practices can have a significant impact on the success of a project\u2014but only if the practices are tailored to the needs and culture of the organization that will use them. However, with these caveats in mind, if one can wisely apply a known best practice and tailor it to the culture of the organization and needs of a particular program, great power can be achieved through improved effectiveness, efficiency, and improvements in overall system performance. In fact, it has been shown that speeding the system development time has numerous positive effects including improved innovation, quality and cost. These are all advantages possible when appropriately leveraging and tailoring a highquality SE knowledge baseline as provided by INCOSE through its numerous SE resources. Furthermore, such an impact can be continally refined and appropriately tailored to become fully integrated and effective through a robust continuous process improvement effort. INCOSE RESOURCES AND SE BEST PRACTICES INCOSE\u2019s depth and breadth of SE resources and best practices stems from its genesis in 1990 when it began to address fundamental issues within the discipline. As a notfor-profit membership organization founded to develop and disseminate the interdisciplinary principles and practices that enable the realization of successful systems INCOSE has more than 7,000 members and 58 chapters worldwide. Collectively the membership works toward providing Systems Engineers the resources and best practices necessary to fulfill INCOSE\u2019s Mission, Vision, and Goals: Mission Share, promote and advance the best of systems engineering from across the globe for the benefit of humanity and the planet. Vision The world\u2019s authority on Systems Engineering. Goals \uf0b7 To provide a focal point for dissemination of systems engineering knowledge. \uf0b7 To promote international collaboration in systems engineering practice, education, and research. \uf0b7 To ensure the establishment of competitive, scaleable professional standards in the practice of systems engineering. \uf0b7 To improve the professional status of all persons engaged in the practice of systems engineering. \uf0b7 To encourage governmental and industrial support for research and educational programs that will improve the systems engineering process and its practice Proceedings of the 2009 Ground Vehicle Systems Engineering and Technology Symposium (GVSETS) Leveraging INCOSE Resources To Identify Systems Engineering Best Practices \u2013 Peterson, Troy Page 3 of 8 As one can see, the Mission, Vision, and Goals of INCOSE are directly related to providing SE best practices, which in turn has led to INCOSE\u2019s development of numerous SE resources (products, publications, handbooks, primers and databases). Many of the products are free to nonmembers and members alike while others are only available to INCOSE members and employees of Corporate Advisory Board (CAB) members.

We relax the assumption of constant price elasticity to linear price elasticity which allows us to model demand and supply that decreases or increases with price. Quantity functions with linear price elasticity have been used in economics before but only to a limited extent since they have not been sufficiently theoretically studied. This paper overcomes this gap by identifying and studying all possible functional forms with linear price elasticity as well as their inverses, actually plotted as demand and supply curves. We find that quantity (demanded or supplied) as a function of price with linear price elasticity is a product of an exponential and a power function of price, while the price as a function of quantity involves the Lambert W function. Hence, the class of functions with linear price elasticity is heterogeneous: it contains reversible and irreversible functional forms as well as convex and non-convex functional forms. The class\u2019 heterogeneity provides several modelling and research opportunities.", "doi": "10.1515/bejte-2017-0015", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "The B.E.

In case of double weeding operations, CIAE wheel hoe + halod (41.36 q/ ha) and manual hand weeding + halod (41.24 q/ha) gave significantly higher maize grain yields as compared to manual hand weeding+manual hand weeding (30.58 q/ha), manual hand weeding+earthing up (32.20 q/ ha) and halod+earthing up (30.80 q/ha).

The weeding sequences of CIAE wheel hoe followed by halod and manual hand weeding followed by halod gave almost similar maize grain yields.

For the next several hundred million years, the young planet was bombarded by comets and meteorites, volcanic eruptions raged across its surface, and its heat boiled the nascent oceans. But within about a billion years\u2014and perhaps much earlier\u2014life had arisen. How nonliving chemicals transformed into living molecules is one of the biggest mysteries in science, and we might never know for sure how it happened. Deep divides in opinion are found in almost all areas of origin-of-life research. Did life begin in extreme heat or relative cold? Were its essential molecules synthesized in the prebiotic ocean, at the mouths of churning deep-sea vents, or did they rain down from space? Did the first life-form get its energy from the sun or from the chemical energy of minerals? Were inherited genetic molecules essential to the first life-form, or could life simply have been a chain of chemical reactions taking place on a rock? \u201cIf we\u2019re going to make any progress, we really have to be critically life couldn\u2019t arise out of nothing, then where did it come from? A few years later, Darwin speculated about chemical reactions in a \u201cwarm little pond,\u201d and Alexander Oparin and J. B. S. Haldane independently took that idea a step further by proposing that life began in a primordial ocean of organic molecules. Origin-of-life research didn\u2019t get its experimental start, however, until the famed chemical synthesis experiments of Stanley Miller and Harold Urey, of the University of Chicago, were published in 1953. By sending an electrical current through a mixture of water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen, they simulated what might have happened when lightning struck the oceans and atmosphere of ancient Earth. What they got\u2014a mixture of key amino acids and other organic molecules\u2014profoundly changed views of the origin of life. The origin of biology was now experimentally approachable. Other groups soon conducted similar experiments, and in the following years, researchers managed to synthesize not only additional amino acids but also other essential biomolecules, including sugars, metabolic acids, and lipids. honest about what we don\u2019t know,\u201d says geochemist George Cody, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just about everything.\u201d The questions surrounding life\u2019s origins are indeed vast and, for the most part, unanswered. A comprehensive explanation of the origin of life will require pinning down the beginnings of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid), of proteins and lipid membranes, of genetic coding and metabolic machinery. In modern life, all of these molecules and processes are so intertwined that it\u2019s difficult to imagine how any of them could have arisen without the others already in place.

Results showed that the average well color development (AWCD) increased gradually with forest age increasing, varying from 0.41 to 1.40 and 0.20 to 0.69 (cultured for 168 hrs) for 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm soil depth, respectively. The peak value of microbial functional diversity was found in 52-year-old plantations, followed by 40-, 30-, 21-year-old in consequence. The microbial functional diversity indices in shallower soil depth all showed higher values: for soil in 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depth, richness index was 12-25 and 6-14, Shannon-Weiner diversity index was 2.55-3.12 and 1.83-2.62, Simpson diversity index was 0.89-0.95 and 0.76-0.91, McIntosh index was 4.22-9.49 and 2.52-6.18, respectively.

As with previous issues, readers will find scholarly yet widely accessible articles on topics of interest to the academic and policy-oriented economics communities. The symposium on The Use of Integrated Assessment Models for Climate Policy contains three excellent and thought-provoking articles. The first, \u201cIntegrated Assessment Models and the Social Cost of Carbon: A Review and Assessment of U.S. Experience,\u201d by Gilbert E. Metcalf and James Stock, presents a balanced overview of recent developments in the use of integrated assessment models (IAMs) to analyze climate change mitigation strategies, with a focus on the role of these models in estimating the social cost of carbon (SCC) for U.S. regulatory purposes. In the second article, \u201cThe Use and Misuse of Models for Climate Policy,\u201d Robert S. Pindyck argues against the use of IAMs for the evaluation of alternative climate change policies and estimation of the SCC and proposes an alternative to an IAM-based SCC. In the third article, \u201cSome Contributions of Integrated Assessment Models of Global Climate Change,\u201d John Weyant argues in favor of the use of IAMs, examining their contributions to the development of climate policy and research, identifying remaining challenges, and suggesting areas for improvement. This issue of REEP also features four regular articles (we have indeed increased the number of articles per issue) on topics that I believe will be of great interest to our readers. The first article, \u201cWhat Drives Deforestation and What Stops It? A Meta-Analysis,\u201d by Jonah Busch and Kalifi Ferretti-Gallon, provides an in-depth and interesting analysis of the causes of deforestation and promising approaches for stopping deforestation. Two articles focus on important lessons for climate policy. \u201cThe Impacts of Unilateral Climate Policy on Competitiveness: Evidence from Computable General Equilibrium Models,\u201d by Jared C. Carbone and Nicholas Rivers, addresses a major concern for policymakers, namely how climate policy affects domestic firms\u2019 competitiveness. In \u201cLessons Learned from Three Decades of Experience with Cap and Trade,\u201d Richard Schmalensee and Robert N. Stavins provide important insights on the design and performance of emissions trading schemes. The fourth article, \u201cWhat Do Environmental and Resource Economists Think? Results from a Survey of AERE Members,\u201d by Timothy C. Haab and John C. Whitehead, discusses the results of a survey of Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (AERE) members on their opinions and beliefs concerning environmental and resource economics issues. This issue of REEP also includes a Policy Monitor article by Jun Rentschler and Morgan Bazilian, \u201cPrinciples for Designing Effective Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reforms,\u201d which provides very useful and timely tools and insights for economists and policymakers.

In arid ecosystems, overgrazing and climate change are particularly detrimental to soil health. In arid Patagonia these processes may lead to a reduction in primary productivity, potentially affecting the populations of herbivorous flightless birds, such as rheas (family Rheidae). We surveyed Lesser Rhea (Rhea pennata pennata) abundance during the breeding and post\u2010breeding seasons of 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 in Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s Protected Area, Province of Chubut, Patagonia, Argentina. Linear transect surveys were conducted in September and December (breeding) and in late summer (post\u2010breeding). Density estimates were corrected by detectability in each kind of habitat. Density was substantially lower for the 2012/2013 season than 2013/2014, probably due to the combination of severe drought and ash\u2010deposition from the eruption of the Puyehue\u2010Caulle volcano in 2011.

Here, we describe nest architecture, parental care behavior, and chick characteristics of the Yellow\u2010eared Toucanet (S. spectabilis) based on a single nest found in Costa Rican mid\u2010elevation forest. The nest was inside a natural cavity of a live tree, contrary to the previous report of an old woodpecker nest in a snag. Both parents provide insects and fruits to the chicks inside the nest. The chicks hatch with closed eyes, pale pink skin, and a bicolor beak.Resumen \u00b7 Descripci\u00f3n de la arquitectura del nido del Tucancillo Orejiamarillo (Selenidera spectabilis) La biolog\u00eda reproductiva de las especies de Selenidera es poco conocida y se limita a dos especies, aunque para todas las especies los per\u00edodos reproductivos son conocidos de forma indirecta (basado sobre tama\u00f1os de g\u00f3nadas en espec\u00edmenes colectados y observaci\u00f3n de juveniles).

Two univariate normal models are considered: the no change hypothesis and a single change in the mean level.

Various multiple test procedures (MTPs) have been developed, which generally aim to control the familywise Type I error rate at the desired level. However, although multiplicity is frequently discussed in the ANOVA literature and MTPs are correspondingly employed, the issue has received considerably little attention in the regression literature and it is rare to see MTPs employed empirically. The present aims are three-fold. First, within the eclectic uses of multiple regression, specific situations are delineated wherein adjusting for multiplicity may be most relevant. Second, the performance of ten MTPs amenable to regression is investigated via familywise Type I error control, statistical power, and, where appropriate, false discovery rate, simultaneous confidence interval coverage and width. Although methodologists may anticipate general patterns, the focus is on the magnitude of error inflation and the size of the differences among methods under plausible scenarios. Third, perspectives from across the scientific literature are discussed, which shed light on contextual factors to consider when evaluating whether multiplicity adjustment is advantageous. Results indicated that multiple testing can be problematic, even in nonextreme situations where multiplicity consequences may not be immediately expected. Results pointed toward several effective, balanced, MTPs, particularly those that accommodate correlated parameters. Importantly, the goal is not to universally recommend MTPs for all regression models, but. rather to identify a set of circumstances wherein multiplicity is most relevant, evaluate MTPs, and integrate diverse perspectives that suggest multiplicity adjustment or alternate solutions.

Even in combination with a lasso penalty, the reduced VAR(1) model (VAR-lasso) is generally outperformed. A reason for the AR dominance is that the VAR-lasso selects models that are still too complex-the space of all possible VAR models includes simpler models but these are hard to select with a traditional lasso penalty. In this article, we propose a reparametrization of the VAR model by decomposing its transition matrix into a symmetric and antisymmetric component (denoted as SAD), allowing us to construct a hierarchy of meaningful signposts in the VAR model space ranging from simple to complex. The decomposition enables the lasso procedure to pick up qualitatively distinct dynamical features in a more targeted way (like relaxation, shearing, and oscillations); this procedure is called SAD-lasso. This leads to a more intuitive interpretation of the reduced models. By removing the antisymmetric component altogether, we obtain a subclass of symmetric VAR models that form a natural extension of the AR model with the same simple relaxation dynamics but allowing for interactions between the system components. We apply these reparametrized and constrained VAR models to 1,391 psychological time series of affect, and compare their predictive accuracy. This analysis indicates that the SAD-lasso is a better regularization technique than the VAR-lasso. Additionally, the results of an extensive simulation study suggest the existence of symmetric interactions for almost half of the time series considered in this article.

The Acute Trauma Exposure Response Scale (ATERS) was intended to assess firefighter and EMS personnel response to acute trauma exposure from analytical, emotional, and physical perspectives.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData were analyzed on 97 firefighter and EMS personnel employed by a fire department in a mid-sized city in a western state. Principal component analysis (PCAR) using Winsteps software was employed to discover which variables in the set formed logical subsets that were independent of one another and included item analyses and assessment of internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha). Rasch analysis included examination of dimensionality, person and item reliability, scale use and function, and construct validity including person-item fit statistics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPrincipal component analyses of residuals (PCAR) revealed three primary scales which were termed Emotional Psyche, Coping Ability, and Support Systems. Rasch analyses showed the ATERS performance to be acceptable as a new pilot measure with three distinct scales through reliability of person separation of .81 for Emotional Psyche, .66 for Coping Ability, and .63 for Support Systems, respectively (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994; Carmines and Zeller, 1979; Devellis, 2012). The Rasch item reliability was .96 for Emotional Psyche, .95 for Coping Ability, and .97 for Support Systems. Response scale use and function was appropriate for each subscale. Validity was supported through PCA by evidence of good internal consistency. High item correlations indicated the items for each subscale were measuring a single construct. Likewise, Rasch analyses provided evidence of validity through an even spread of person ability to item difficulty for each of the three constructs. Good item fit provided proof of construct relevant variance and the absence of gaps along the unidimensional continuum indicated each construct to be represented adequately.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe ATERS performs well as a measure of acute trauma exposure response for three primary constructs: Emotional Psyche, Coping Ability, and Support Systems with good Rasch person internal consistency reliability and factor structure. Items were deleted for each scale following PCA and Rasch analyses due to misfit and low loadings. Further research is recommended to optimally represent each construct in regards to person-item fit.

Phase change materials (PCMs) have been recently employed to introduce all-optical non-volatile memory in integrated photonic circuits, especially finding application as non-volatile weighting element in photonic artificial neural networks. Interestingly, these weighting elements can potentially be used as building blocks for large-scale networks that can autonomously adapt to their input, i.e. presenting the property of plasticity, similarly to the biological brain. In this work, we develop a computationally efficient dynamical model of a silicon ring resonator (RR) enhanced by a phase change material, namely Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST). We do so starting from two existing dynamical models (of a silicon RR and of a GST thin film on a straight silicon waveguide), but extending the optical equations to properly account for the high absorption and asymmetry in the ring due to the phase change material. Our model accounts for silicon nonlinear effects due to free carriers and temperature, as well as for the phase change of GST, whose energy efficiency and optical contrast can be enhanced by the RR resonant behaviour. We also restructure the optical equations so that the model can be efficiently employed in a modular way within a commercial software for system-level photonics simulations. Moreover, exploiting the developed model, we explore several design parameters and show that both speed and energy efficiency of memory operations can be enhanced by factors from six to ten. Also, we show that the achievable optical contrast due to GST phase change can be increased by more than a factor ten by leveraging the resonant properties of the RR, at the expense of higher optical loss. Finally, by exploiting the nonlinear dynamics arising in silicon RR networks, we show that a strong contrast is achievable while preserving energy efficiency.", "doi": "10.1364/oe.459364", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Optics express", "venue": "Optics Express", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Automatic recognition and experimental study of loudspeaker\u2019s quality based on characteristics of timbre", "abstract": "In the quality inspection process of speakers,the traditional methods involve listening inspection and frequency domain detection.However,listening inspection does not have quantitative criteria,which leads to different results by different inspectors.In addition,it is harmful to the workers\u2019 hearing.Detecting the characteristics in frequency domain can only detect some physical characteristics and rarely consider the role of timbre.Sometimes two loudspeakers have the same frequency curve with different timbre.In this paper we fully account for the effect of timber on the loudspeakers\u2019 quality,extract the characteristics that reflect the representation of timbre,and use automatic classification method to determine the quality of loudspeaker,meanwhile comparing the amount of computation for these characteristics.This method fully takes into account the characteristics of human ear that suit more to people\u2019s listening habits,and meantime increases the recognition rate.", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Technical Acoustics", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Numerical study based on experimental datas of the active control applied to the flow past a backward facing ramp", "abstract": "This work is based on Dan Hlevca and his co-authors\u2019 experimental study [5] on the active control applied to the flow past a backward facing ramp inclined to 25\u00b0. Following the study of the mean and unsteady flow without control applied, the authors use the control technique of pulsed jets because they are interested in the influence of the variation of the duty cycle DC, keeping the blowing time constant. In their conclusion they highlight the disappearance of the recirculation bubble at the back of the body and the recovery of pressure at whatever frequency and the applied DC. An estimate of the drag coefficient is calculated by extrapolating the pressure measurements taken in a median longitudinal plane. The authors remain cautious about interpretations related to the drag coefficient, not knowing explicitly the pressure distribution on the body in the transverse dimension. The present work is the numerical portion of this study. RANS simulations with first order turbulence models were conducted to try to extract the solution on the mean flow in a relatively short time. The incapacity of RANS models of the first order classical turbulence model to determine a precise solution of the mean flow around this type of geometry imposed a mixed numerical strategy URANS-LES, also named DES (detached eddy simulation). Characteristics of the mean and unsteady flow are thus found, which made it possible to validate the numerical DES approach chosen and to consider the solution obtained as a suitable estimation of the physical problem. A restriction of the computation domain with the introduction of synthetic turbulent fluctuations at the inlet makes it possible to envisage, on the delay of this internship and with the computer means at disposal, a simulation of the controlled case. We could afterwards look at the pressure distribution of the entire body and determine the influence of the pulsed jets on the pressure drag coefficient.", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}], "archaeology": [{"title": "A Letter to Aphrodisias in Caria", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Echos du monde classique: Classical views", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Third Workshop on Gender, Methodology, and the Ancient Near East", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1086/705419", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Near Eastern Archaeology", "venue": "Near Eastern Archaeology", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Asia's Democracy Puzzle: Five Uneasy Pieces", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1353/apr.2020.0027", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Asian Perspective", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Terrakotten aus Pergamon.

Looking back over the papers that have been published in TODS, it\u2019s easy to see the tremendous impact the journal has had, and it\u2019s humbling to be associated with such history. Iconic papers such as \u201cThe Entity-Relationship Model\u2014Toward a Unified View of Data,\u201d by Peter Chen, \u201cSystem R: Relational Approach to Database Management,\u201d by Morton Astrahan and colleagues, and \u201cThe Design and Implementation of INGRES,\u201d by Stonebraker et al., are just a few of the classics that have appeared in TODS. And aside from all of the history, one of the most exciting aspects of the EiC job is working with the TODS Editorial Board. The Board is an amazing group of researchers. While TODS is healthy and continues to publish great papers, I think that we all need to acknowledge that this is a challenging time for even the very best journals in computer science. Conferences continue to be the preferred publication venue for many researchers. In particular, TODS seems to get relatively few original submissions focused on \u201chard core\u201d database system building. I hope to listen to authors over the upcoming months to really understand why that is, but I suspect that some authors perceive that conferences have faster time-until-publication, or that perhaps the burden on authors is not as significant, in terms of pleasing conference reviewers. While there is some truth to that\u2014TODS has very high standards\u2014I hope we can convince authors that there are some key benefits to submitting original work to a journal such as TODS. Most obvious is that we can take the time to carefully match a TODS submission with an Associate Editor (AE) and reviewers who are world-class experts in the area of the submission. Reviews are themselves carefully reviewed by the AE and by the Editor-in-Chief, lowering the variance of the reviewing process. At TODS, we\u2019ll work really hard to make sure that we don\u2019t reject good papers. I\u2019d like to end this note by thanking the outgoing Editor-in-Chief, Christian Jensen, for his contribution to TODS. Christian ran the journal for six years, during which time TODS operated like a finely tuned machine. In the upcoming years, I hope to continue to pursue some of Christian\u2019s best ideas, such as obtaining closer integration between TODS and the ACM SIGMOD/PODS conferences.

The material removal rate and surface roughness obtained remained almost the same as the concentration was varied from 0.2 wt% to 20 wt%. However, smaller surface roughness was obtained with a smaller depth of cut under a lower electrolyte concentration. Hence, the deterioration of the geometrical accuracy of the workpiece owing to the electrochemical finishing operation can be better suppressed using a lower electrolyte concentration. The measured glossiness of the finished surface obtained with a lower electrolyte concentration was higher. To understand the reason for the particular characteristics obtained from a lower electrolyte concentration, the temperature and current density distributions were analyzed. The results showed that the current density is more localized in a gap with lower electrolyte concentrations owing to Joule heating. Consequently, considering environmental issues, the use of the 0.2 wt% electrolyte is the most appropriate under the conditions adopted in the present work.", "doi": "10.2526/jseme.54.10", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of The Japan Society of Electrical Machining Engineers", "venue": "Journal of The Japan Society of Electrical Machining Engineers", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Feedback Error Learning with Sliding Mode Control for Functional Electrical Stimulation: Elbow Joint Simulation", "abstract": "Motivation: Upper-limb motor impairment is one of the most common consequences after Stroke. Limited capability for performing reaching and grasping movements hinders the execution of most activities of daily living. Consequently, the quality lives of the affected individuals are severely compromised. Due to these facts, the recovery of the upper limb functional capabilities is currently one of the keystones of the rehabilitation therapy. Background: Researchers are developing new methods and technologies to boost the outcomes of rehabilitation therapy. A hybrid robotic system has been proposed as a promising rehabilitation technology that combines a passive device (Armeo Spring exoskeleton) to support the arm weight against gravity with a Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) system to execute the reaching task. This system provides to patients the possibility of training specifically and intensive exercises. Objective: The main objective of this paper is to investigate the performance and robustness of a Feedback Error learning (FEL) scheme mixed with sliding mode control (SMC) to control the FES. Methods: We implemented a nonlinear model describing the muscle response to FES and the dynamic behavior of the elbow joint. Using this model we carried out a simulation study to compare four control strategies: computed torque control (CTC), sliding mode Control (SMC), and adaptive feedback control using FEL: ANN+ CTC and FEL: ANN+SMC. We tested these controllers in two different simulation conditions: In the absence and presence of fatigue. To check the performance of the controllers, we compared the root means square (RMSE) of tracking error and the Normalized RMS of muscle stimulation for various range of movement (ROM). Results: All four controllers achieved good tracking performance in the absence of perturbations. When introducing muscle fatigue, good tracking performance is given essentially by the adaptive control ANN+SMC. Conclusion: Among the proposed approaches, we conclude that the adaptive control (FEL: ANN + SMC) is the most efficient and robust controller, which has been proven by calculating RMSE.", "doi": "10.35940/ijitee.k2026.1081219", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering", "venue": "International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Facial Expression Recognition Based on Improved United Model", "abstract": "On the basis of the idea of unifying Active Appearance Model(AAM) and Active Shape Model(ASM), this paper mines the relation of peg points fully and proposes a method to construct local vein model.

I have been a game-day coach for the Lions at several U.S. National Championships since I last played in 2004.

I am certain that every sport has its equivalent, and these have been formative to the emergence of great leaders and orators all over the world. This is my final opportunity to address the IEEE Control Systems Society (CSS) as president and exhort us to take the ball uphill into the wind and score mightily in the last quarter before we hit 2020.

Since composing this final column for the December issue occurs in early August, I have just returned from the 38th Chinese Control Conference (CCC) in Guangzhou. With more than 2000 attendees, this is the largest annual control conference. It is only rivaled in size by the triennial IFAC World Congress. I was positively delighted to participate in the CCC but was most impressed by certain central factors: the burgeoning numbers of young control adherents among the attendees and presenters, the willingness of many to engage in questioning at plenary panel discussions, the very significant proportion of women control engineers, and the strong involvement of volunteer graduate students (largely from the local Guangdong University of Technology). I attended several regular sessions consisting of 20-min presentations with the ever-present Beamer projector slides. The slides were always in English and well structured. The same was true for the poster sessions. Roughly two-thirds of the presentations were in English, and one-third of them were delivered in Chinese, Mandarin rather than the localized Cantonese. The application of the conference opportunity to gain presentation experience, feedback, and expertise was great to observe. Of course, being one of the more linguistically limited attendees, I had to ask my questions in English, and the speakers (many of whom were graduate students) did their best to respond in English to me.

Three ultrasonic sensors and two proximity sensors served as the eyes of the ALM for navigation and obstacle avoidance while the cutting blade was made of stainless steel and controlled by a brushless direct current (BLDC) motor. A fuzzy algorithm was implemented on an Arduino controller with the inputs and outputs as directional instructions. Obstacle avoidance was achieved by setting a range of values for the sensors interpreted by the fuzzy logic for the corresponding output in the form of navigations. Three trials tests were conducted on the ALM on a 5 m2 portion of land with an average grass height of 0.09 m. The average cut area was 4.46 m2, therefore achieving an efficiency of 89.2%, which is highly productive.

Cognitive Radio principles can be applied to HF communications, to make use of the spectrum more efficiently. A significant improvement of Cognitive Radio technique can be achieved by spectrum occupancy prediction, which enables proactive efficient spectrum utilization. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) can be a useful tool for statistical spectrum occupancy prediction. In some of our previous works, we investigated a simple HMM in time domain, as well as a bidimensional model, that take into account both the time domain and the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose to extend the coverage of the model, by considering in addition to time and frequency the geographical position of the two points involved in the radio connection. The work is motivated by the fact that the two points of the radio link in HF can be far apart, and the channel availability at the two points could be different. Therefore, finding and exploiting correlations between the spectrum occupancy at the two points might improve the connectivity. The proposed model is validated using real spectrum occupancy data collected simultaneously at two locations situated in two cities, namely Timi\u0219oara and Sibiu, Romania.

Vertebral balance disorders are a health issue for children in general, with long-term consequences. Having in view that the number of new cases with this condition has increased, it is necessary to introduce health programs and it is useful to make a screening for vertebral balance disorders by age groups (prepubertal, pubertal, adolescent). The objective of the study was to evaluate the functional status of the child aged 10-12 and the elaboration of the prophylaxis/ treatment program. The purpose was to draw the attention to the prevalence of vertebral balance disorders in youth, with possible consequences in adulthood. Material and method. The study was conducted for a period of 1 year and included a number of 86 children. After the clinical, anthropometric, somatoscopic evaluation, the recovery plan was elaborated, but also the prophylaxis plan was elaborated for certain cases. The purpose was to create the correct posture reflex, the toning of the paravertebral and abdominal muscles, the increase in the mobility of the joints and the fight against obesity. The kinetic program took place 3 times/ week, with a duration of 30 minutes/ session. Also, the children attended a weekly therapeutic swimming session. Results. It was found in the study group that over 51% were girls, approximately 30.23% of the children were diagnosed with scoliotic attitude, 44.19% with kyphotic attitude and approximately 25.58% had a normal postural attitude. Conclusions. After the use of the physiotherapy program (on the land and in the water), it was found that the general alignment, the concentration capacity and the adaptation to the school activities improved.

But perhaps it\u2019s Moretti\u2019s metaphor which \u2018misses the point\u2019.

The answer to that question has commonly been posed as a choice between the \u201cpolice power\u201d \u2014 a sovereign government\u2019s power to regulate and restrict property\u2019s use in order to further the public health, safety, and welfare \u2014 and the eminent domain power, the authority to seize private property for public use with the corresponding requirement to pay compensation. \n \nBut that should not be the question. An invocation of police power does not answer the compensation question at all, but is merely the predicate issue: all government actions must be for the public health, safety, or welfare, in the same way that an exercise of eminent domain power must be for a public use. In \u201cnormal\u201d times, it is very difficult to win a regulatory takings claim for compensation. In the midst of emergencies \u2014 real or perceived \u2014 the courts are even more reluctant to provide a remedy, even where they should, and emergencies are a good time to make bad law, especially takings law. \n \nThis article provides a road-map for analyzing these questions, hoping that it will result in a more consistent approach to resolving claims for compensation that arise out of claims of emergencies \u2014 real or perceived. This article analyzes the potential takings claims stemming from emergency measures, mostly under current takings doctrine. What type of claims are likely to succeed or fail? Can a better case be made analytically for compensation? \n \nPart I summarizes the economic \u201cflattening the curve\u201d principle that motivates takings claims for compensation. Part II sets out the prevailing three-factor Penn Central standard for how courts evaluate claims that a health, safety, or welfare measure \u201cgoes too far,\u201d and requires compensation as a taking, examining the character of the government action, the impact of the action on the owner, and the extent of the owner\u2019s property rights. Deep criticism of Penn Central is beyond the scope of this article, and I will not here do more than accept it as the \u201cdefault\u201d takings test. But I do argue that the government\u2019s motivation and reason for its actions \u2014 generally reviewed under the \u201crational basis\u201d standard \u2014 should not be a major question in takings claims. Rather, as this article argues in Part III, the government\u2019s emergency justifications should be considered as part of a necessity defense, and not subject to the low bar of rational basis, but a more fact and evidence driven standard of \u201cactual necessity.\u201d Part IV attempts to apply these standards and examines the various ways that emergency actions can take property for public use: commandeering, occupations of property, and restrictions on use. I do not conclude that the approach will result in more (or less) successful claims for compensation, merely a more straightforward method of evaluating emergency takings claims than the current disjointed analytical methods. \n \nIn sum, this article argues there is no blanket immunity from compensation simply because the government claims to be acting in response to an emergency, even though its reasons and actions may satisfy the rational basis test. Instead, claims that the taking is not compensable because of the exigency of an emergency should only win the day if the government successfully shows that the measure was actually needed to avoid imminent danger posed by the property owner\u2019s use, and that the measure was narrowly tailored to further that end.", "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.3593789", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Public Economics: Miscellaneous Issues eJournal", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Abstract 1334: A diagnostic platform for precision cancer therapy enabling composite biomarkers by combining tumor and immune features from an enhanced exome and transcriptome", "abstract": "There is an increasing need for more advanced, composite biomarkers that can model the complex systems biology driving response and resistance to cancer therapy. However, many cancer diagnostic platforms to date, with their focus on mutational changes in a relatively small panel of genes, provide limited data to support integrative, multidimensional biomarkers that can better predict immunotherapy response. To enable the identification of composite biomarkers that combine tumor- and immune-related information from both DNA and RNA, we have developed ImmunoID NeXT, an enhanced exome/transcriptome-based diagnostic platform that can simultaneously profile the tumor and immune system from a single FFPE sample, across all of the approximately 20,000 genes. By co-optimizing assay and analytics design, we enable sensitive evaluation of clinically-relevant cancer biomarkers from >=25ng of co-extracted DNA/RNA, while also providing a broader evaluation of neoantigens, HLA typing and LOH, antigen processing machinery (APM), TCR/BCR repertoire, immune expression signatures, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), oncoviruses, and germline variants. Leveraging this expansive feature set, we developed methods that combine individual analytes to construct composite biomarker scores that correlate with immunotherapy response. Validation of ImmunoID NeXT demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity to somatic and structural variants across ~20,000 genes at allelic fractions as low as 5%, with clinical diagnostic reporting on actionable mutations (SNVs, indels, CNAs, fusions) in 248 cancer-driver genes that have been boosted further for higher sensitivity, as well as reporting on TMB and MSI status. For neoantigen prediction, immuno-peptidomic data from monoallelic HLA-transfected cell lines were used to train neural networks to predict pMHC binding with higher precision than public tools. For TCR\u03b1/\u03b2 analysis in FFPE tumor samples, strong correlation with targeted TCR kit results was shown (R^2>0.9 and >0.94). For TILs, we developed signatures for eight immune cell types, demonstrating concordance with orthogonal immunofluorescence methods. We achieved genotyping accuracy of 99.1% for HLA Class I, and 95% for HLA Class II, and have developed and verified the performance of a tool for HLA LOH detection. In a cohort of 55 late-stage melanoma patients, the integration of neoantigen burden, HLA LOH, and APM mutational data formed a composite neoantigen score that more accurately predicted response to checkpoint blockade than other markers such as TMB. With ImmunoID NeXT, we have developed a broad diagnostic platform that can be leveraged for the development of advanced composite biomarkers (and novel resistance mechanisms) that combine both tumor and immune features from DNA and RNA; enabling more accurate stratification of patient response to immunotherapy. The platform has been validated and optimized for use with limited FFPE tissue samples, making it ideal for both research and clinical applications.

There are different feature selection methods and sampling methods to address issues. However, the task of feature selection and sampling interact with each other has not been studied. We study the impact of the interaction in terms of the five performance measures of AUC, accuracy, precision, recall and F1 of defect prediction.

The studying result shows that when chi-square and IG are used for feature selection, it is better to sample first for both sampling methods in terms of AUC and recall, when relief is used and NB, LR and SVM are used, it is a good choice to perform feature selection first in terms of AUC and recall, and it is better to sample first when using DT classification.", "doi": "10.1109/DSA51864.2020.00025", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "2020 7th International Conference on Dependable Systems and Their Applications (DSA)", "venue": "International Conferences on Dependable Systems and Their Applications", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Cancer: Stressing out cancer cells", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1038/471139e", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Nature", "venue": "Nature", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Integrated bright broadband PDC source for quantum metrology", "abstract": "We demonstrate a broadband quantum light source employing non-degenerate type II parametric down conversion in a 40 mm long periodically poled LiNbO3 waveguide, pumped with a narrowband CW laser.

Unfortunately, this is the approach to international adoption embraced and promoted by the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, the adoption laws of most of its state parties, the policies of UNICEF and the attitudes of many childcare and advocacy groups around the world. To disapprove of their views is not to question their good intentions or seriousness of purpose. The problem, in fact, is deeper, and ultimately rests on muddled conceptions of human rights and the personhood of children. A few examples will suffice to illustrate the point and set the record straight. Conspicuously in Article 1, the Hague Convention announces what will be the emphasis throughout the treaty, \u2018to prevent the abduction, the sale of, or traffic in children\u2019. UNICEF\u2019s policy statements on international adoption tend to reinforce this approach to international adoption, denouncing \u2018the growth of an industry around adoption, where profit, rather than the best interests of children, takes centre stage\u2019. Unicef\u2019s Children on the Brink 2004: A Joint Report of New Orphan Estimates and a Framework for Action documents the shocking number of 16,200,000 double orphans in Africa, Asia and Latin America alone. Despite that, the 46-page report mentions adoption \u2044 adoptive just twice, and then only in the context of makeshift or half-hearted localonly adoption options: \u2018There is a pressing need to ensure that family based care is available for these children, either through support for relatives, foster care, local adoptive placement, or community organizations that are integrally linked to the community\u2019 (p. 15); \u2018For children who slip through the extended family safety net, arrangements preferable to traditional institutional care include foster placements, local adoption, surrogate family groups integrated into communities, and smaller-scale group residential care in homelike settings\u2019 (p. 20). In the same report, institutionalization is referred to euphemistically as \u2018Center for Orphaned Children\u2019, \u2018Community School\u2019, \u2018Day Care Center\u2019, \u2018Center for Children\u2019 and the like. The historical lineage of the position taken by the Hague Convention and UNICEF is no mystery. From as early as the 15th century, struggles to form and consolidate nation states turned into efforts to create large and replenishable armies and working forces. From the perspective of emerging nation states, the first and most precious natural resource was their population, and the highest policy priority population management. \u2018The principal object of my policy\u2019, stated Joseph II in the 18th century, was \u2018the preservation and increase of the number of subjects. It is\u2019, he added, \u2018from the greatest number of subjects that all the advantages of the state derive\u2019. This view became part of the policy DNA of nation states and, after the Second World War, of their international organization creatures. By the second part of the 20th century, population management ideologies were compounded by the inability or unwillingness to transcend the resilience of localism and culturalism against clear commitment to the universalism of the human rights of the child as a person. No one should think it is easy to honor mandates as important as the individual rights of the child when deeply torn between contradicting values and rationales. On the other hand, in many ways it has never been better to be a child than in our time. The evolution of the legal and moral status of the child has, however, been a slow one. It took millennia for children to progress from being little more than labor and transactional resource for families and reserve and replacement economic and military resource for states. Later, children came to be seen by postcolonial sensibilities as culture carriers. In most parts of the world, only relatively recently have children achieved the legal status of object of protection on the part of families, societies and states. Twenty years ago the arc of this evolution reached the point of considering the child as an independent, self-standing subject of human rights. But the earlier stages of the evolution of the legal and moral status of the child have never been completely replaced. The result is the truncated and ambivalent conception of the *E.

Spin defects in solids combine the repeatability and precision available to atomic and cryogenic systems with substantial advantages in compactness and range of operating conditions. However, in spite of experimental progress in specific systems, solid-state spin sensors still lack a universal, high-fidelity readout technique. Here we demonstrate high-fidelity, room-temperature readout of an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers via strong coupling to a dielectric microwave cavity, building on similar techniques commonly applied in cryogenic circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics. This strong collective interaction allows the spin ensemble's microwave transition to be probed directly, thereby overcoming the optical photon shot noise limitations of conventional fluorescence readout. Applying this technique to magnetometry, we show magnetic sensitivity approaching the Johnson-Nyquist noise limit of the system.

The introduction of trapping structures in perovskite cells can change the photon propagation in the cell and the photon energy absorbed by the cell. The nano-structure used in different interfaces of perovskite cells can increase the absorption of light by the device to different degrees, and ultimately improve the efficiency of the solar cell. Therefore, the effective light trapping structure has become trending in the application of perovskite cells. How to effectively apply the such nano-structure is the key to improve the power conversion efficiency(PCE) of perovskite cells. So far, there is three ways including surface antireflection nanostructure, texture structure and plasmon nanostructure to apply to perovskite solar cell. The first one is ordered and disordered antireflection nanostructure that enhance the absorption of light on the surface of perovskite cells and makes visible light scatter at the interface of the nanostructure to reflection probability, the second one is texture structure that can not only improve the light absorption but avoid the formation of short-circuit channel inside the cell, the third one is plasmon nanostructure that can further improve the absorption of the thin film absorption material in the long band, so as to achieve the effect of improving the light utilization and cell efficiency. The trap structure is expected to achieve good photon absorption performance in wide spectral range and wide incidence angle range under the condition of reducing the thickness of active layer. At the same time, it has the advantages of good repeatability, easy to simulate and easy to change the structure. Therefore, using various trap technologies to design efficient trap structure has become a research hotspot in the field of solar cells. So far, most of the reports on the trapping structure have been applied to the silicon-based thin film solar cells, but few of them have been reported on the perovskite cells.

It is our opinion that, despite the title, the study did not use a case-control design because of the longitudinal aspect of the study. Also, patients were not selected according to the outcome of interest, as is the procedure for a case-control study; instead, patients were selected with respect to age, a possible exposure category. The selection criteria suggest that the study actually used a cohort study design, with one-half of the analysis a basic cohort analysis and the other half a matched cohort analysis, with patients matched on duration of deafness and preimplantation Hearing in Noise Test\u2013Quiet (HINT-Q) score. Because of the matching of younger and older patients, a paired t test should have been used to test for differences in the matched pairs; however, it appears that the 2 groups were inappropriately treated as independent. The authors conclude that there were significant differences by age group in Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (P=.02) and HINT-Q (P=.02) scores 1 year after implantation; however, analysis using a paired t test for the matched cohort data provided in the table suggested that there were no significant differences by age group in Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (P=.06) or HINT-Q (P=.07) scores. Therefore, the conclusion that elderly patients should not be expected to have hearing scores as high as those of younger patients with similar characteristics cannot be supported statistically, as the P values exceeded .05 (acknowledging that the absolute differences remained unchanged). Finally, as with any longitudinal study, it is possible that the results are biased because of a regression toward the mean. If this bias were differential between the older and younger cohorts (eg, younger cohorts were more likely to have extreme measurements of hearing tests in relation to their true mean scores), then both the validity and the interpretation of the results are questionable. The authors should review the literature on the topic of testing and correcting for regression to the mean and determine whether this particular bias is present in their data.

However, the flux generated by the PMs would cause large stator core loss during the idling state of FESS, which would reduce the energy conversion ratio and limit the application of FESS in long-term energy storage occasions. Addressing this issue, a novel dual-rotor single-stator coreless PM machine (DSSCPMM) with dual-flywheel is proposed in this article. The stator of the DSSCPMM is made of ceramic material, which can effectively eliminate the stator core loss. The rotor of the DSSCPMM contains inner and outer rotors, which are used as the flywheels and can be helpful to improve the energy storage density. First, the structure and operation principle of the proposed DSSCPMM are illustrated. Then, the influences of the key structure parameters and arrangement of PMs, winding configurations, and magnetization method on the electromagnetic performance of the proposed DSSCPMM are investigated.

The new guidelines subdivided prognostic stage groups 3 and 4 into four groups based on regional lymph node (LN) and metastasis location. In the 7th edition, T3A-T4A N0 M0 were group 3 while group 4 included T4B, N1-3, and M1 patients. In the 8th Edition guidelines: group 3A includes T3A-T4A and N1 patients, group 3B includes N2-3 patients, group 4A includes T4B and M1A patients, and group 4B includes M1B patients. We sought to justify these changes in our institutional cohort. METHODS: We retrospectively identified radical cystectomy patients with T3A-T4B N0 M0 disease and patients with N1-3 disease at our institution (2000-2016). Eight or more LN removed was considered appropriate to determine LN status. Patients were stratified according to AJCC 7th and 8th Edition staging. Baseline differences in demographics were compared and Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to assess recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between groups. Recurrence was considered unknown if follow up time was less than 1 month. RESULTS: A total of 333 patients were included in the analysis. No T4B, N3, nor M1 patients were included due to limited sample size. Median LN removed was 18. Median follow-up time was 23.5 months. Demographics were similar between groups. Seventh edition Group 3 (n=153) and Group 4 (n=180) patients differed significantly in RFS (p= 0.032) and OS (p= 0.004). Eighth edition Group 3A (n=222) and Group 3B (n=111) patients differed in respect to RFS (p< 0.001) and OS (p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The 8th edition AJCC guidelines more accurately predict RFS and OS in muscle invasive and LN positive bladder cancer compared to the 7th edition guidelines. Specifically, characterizing N1-3 as Stage 3 and different from metastatic, Stage 4 disease, while differentiating solitary positive pelvic LN (Stage 3a) from multiple or distal positive LN (Stage 3b) more accurately prognosticates bladder cancer patients after cystectomy.

Prior studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of hypogonadism (HG) in men with cancer and who undergo anesthesia/major surgery. The suppression of testosterone persists up to seven days following surgery. We hypothesize that hypogonadism is prevalent in male patients undergoing RC for bladder cancer (BC), and that it persists in the post-operative period. METHODS: We implemented a prospective, IRB-approved trial (Clinical trials.gov # NCT03063125) to prospectively enroll 25 men with no prior history of treatment for HG or other hormonal disorders with a new diagnosis of non-metastatic bladder cancer undergoing RC. Pre-operative total (TT), free testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) were obtained. These labs were then repeated on post-operative days 2, 3, 30, and 90. The threshold for normal total testosterone was defined as >300 ng/dl. Demographic data were recorded. RESULTS: From March 2017-March 2018, 25 patients were enrolled into the study. Twenty-three men completed the trial. Mean patient age was 68.9 years (52-85). The mean pre-operative TT was 308 ng/dl (range 50-566 ng/dl) and 12/23 (52.5%) patients had HG. Three patients had abnormal pre-operative LH levels (range 21-57 mIU/L). Mean post-operative day TT was 166 ng/dl (range 32-345). 19/20 (95%) of men had HG. In total, 7 men (30%) who were eugonadal pre-op migrated into hypogonadism post-operatively. Mean post-operative day 30 TT was 253 ng/dl (range 40 -518) and 12/19 (63%) patients who had labs drawn were hypogonadal. At post-op day 90, 37% of men who had AM labs drawn had HG. CONCLUSIONS: Hypogonadism is prevalent in men undergoing RC; our trial demonstrates a pre-op immediate post-op, and 30 day post-operative prevalence of 52%, 95%, and 37.5% respectively. Furthermore, HG persisted beyond the immediate post-operative period. Treatment of peri-operative HG with correction to a eugonadal state may represent a therapeutic intervention to reduce the morbidity associated with radical cystectomy.

Thoughts for the Future Based on a Decade of Progress in Understanding and Modelling Hydrologic and Erosion Processes", "abstract": "Empiricist and hypothetico-deductive traditions have served well in the development of the understanding of hydrologic and erosion processes across a range of disciplinary backgrounds. Because data are hard-won, there is a tendency to give emphasis to them in developing understanding, but this emphasis often ignores the conceptual underpinning of the data leading to a range of problems such as the affirmation of the consequent. Realist approaches have more recently stressed the importance of multi-methodological and iterative approaches in producing more coherent process understanding. A range of interdisciplinary work on ecohydrology and ecogeomorphology has also started to focus on the limitations of approaches grounded in general systems theory as producing inherently static representations of the environment. Increasingly, complex systems theory has been applied to these fields in order to represent the dynamics of the environment, interactions across different spatial scales, and the evolution of its parts. These developments have occurred in parallel with critiques of understanding and managing environmental systems based on equilibrium concepts. A second strand of progress relates to technological advances. Across a range of scales, methods such as satellite and airborne remote sensing and particle imaging have made observations about the detail of environmental patterns clearer, which has helped challenge or clarify existing interpretations, e.g. of flow processes. Increasing miniaturization and computational advances are also enabling many flow and erosion processes to be instrumented and analyzed at appropriate spatio-temporal scales. This presentation will draw on both conceptual and technological advances to evaluate how these two strands are intertwined. It will use a range of examples to evaluate how process conceptualization affects measurement and how numerical and hardware modelling can be used as a means of integrating and strictly testing process knowledge. Based on these evaluations, it will conclude with an overview of some of the key challenges for the next decade.", "doi": "10.13031/2013.39203", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Parameter Estimation for Improving Association Indicators in Binary Logistic Regression", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Coating of ships: The design challenge", "abstract": "In July 2007, IMO adopted amendments to SOLAS by resolution MSC216(82) which mandated compliance with the new IMO \u201cPerformance Standard for Protective Coatings for dedicated seawater ballast tanks in all types of ships and double-side skin spaces of bulk carriers\u201d, (IMO PSPC; Resolution MSC 215(82)).

The novel tackles the intricacies of the mother-daughter bond through the story of a middle-aged woman and a young girl who become mother and daughter through a voluntary rapport, independent of bloodlines. Biological and elective motherhood are presented as two distinct ties, which serve different purposes in a child\u2019s life. Accabadora suggests that parenthood is a temporary condition, an implication that significantly reshapes the mother-daughter relationship and its symbolic significance. Not only does Murgia depict a daughter who is the child of several mothers, she also presents a mother whose role is not to give life, but rather to take it. Accabadora radically problematizes what is traditionally understood as a maternal role. In fact, along with the most obvious biological functions of giving birth and nurturing, motherhood here incorporates other social duties that are neither biological, nor necessarily linked to the care of children. Drawing upon ancient Greek mythology, psychoanalysis, feminist thought, and literary theory, I investigate how a broadened notion of motherhood and non-biological kinship reshapes the mother-daughter relationship in its contemporary literary representation.", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "A Japanese American Female Writer's Tearing Down the Barriers: Lydia Minatoya's Talking to High Monks in the Snow and The Strangeness of Beauty", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.15839/EACS.10.2.201008.1", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "English & American Cultural Studies", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Arab Muslim women after the uprisings: the encounter between the liberalisation of Islamist politics and the feminisation of Islamic interpretation", "abstract": "Women\u2019s participation in the Arab uprisings \nhas been inspired by the expansion of an \nIslamist-based model of Arab women\u2019s \nactivism and a gradual shrinking of secular \nliberal women\u2019s activism.

Collectively, this behavior is motivated by the quest for social recognition and status, but there are also signs the behavior is sanctioned\u2014if not subtly guided\u2014by the ruling Communist party\u2019s logic of governing. Using the Foucauldian concept of \u201cgovernmentality,\u201d this article posits that the authoritarian Chinese regime tacitly utilizes noncoercive means to direct the middle class away from activism toward conspicuous consumption. Specifically, through tactics like real name registration (RNR) and value-laden mass media ads and programs, an environment is created that encourages conspicuous consumption as a form of calculated \u201cpastoral\u201d control. This allows government to guide without confrontation. Consequently, the emergent middle class is confronted with the pressure to navigate their own consumption patterns to align with the government\u2019s quasi-veiled preferences that the citizenry should engage with materialist consumption rather than politics. China uses governmentality to orient the new middle-class citizen to consume and to steer away from political engagement that poses a possible threat to the communist regime. Despite insightful arguments about both consumption and governmentality and a growing scholarly interest in the rise of the middle class in China few studies examine the relationship between the conspicuous consumption habits of the Chinese middle class and the governmentality of the ruling party, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Mass media and consumer culture reinforce each other to create a stable climate based upon market rationality and consumerism. The CCP has two roles in indoctrinating the new middle class through noncoercive ways. The mobilization of mass media in terms of real name registration and traditional media outlets such as newspapers reflect a way of life that allows middle class citizens to maintain their good life and status to pursue their dreams under Xi\u2019s regime. This status persists through consumption for the self and others (as a practice of gift giving) alongside apolitical involvement. The CCP focuses on entrepreneurs\u2019 success stories as the epitome of good citizenship. Participation in political activities is discouraged by removing it from even being mentioned, discussed, or even shown in any of these accounts. This indirectly positions apolitical involvement as a lifestyle that allows citizens to be cosmopolitan individuals and quality (suzhi\u7d20\u8cea) citizens in post-Reform China.", "doi": "10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0325", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Political Science", "venue": "Political science", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Innovation for Sustainability", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1108/s1057-1922202025", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Research in Rural Sociology and Development", "venue": "Research in Rural Sociology and Development", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Creativity, plasticity, quality: on the emergence of a new food offering in Paris", "abstract": "This paper presents the conditions of the recent emergence of quality fast food restaurants in Paris.

This is especially important when dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI is used to characterize tumor vasculature, following the pharmacokinetics of the injected contrast agent over an extended period. However, choice of anesthesia for animals in DCE-MRI is often only based on the consideration of safety, effectiveness, and conveniences despite the vasoactive nature of some anesthetics. This report compared the DCE-MRI studies of tumor vasculature with a macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-(DTPA-Gd), performed on mice anesthetized by isoflurane alone, and a combination of ketamine/acepromazine induction and isoflurane maintenance. Material and Methods: Female SCID mice bearing MCF-7 human breast tumor xenografts at the sizes of 100 \u2013 200 mm were used for this report. In preparation for DCE-MRI studies, mouse tail vein was cannulated with a 25G needle after the induction of anesthesia. Mice were divided into two groups. Anesthesia was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine (25 mg/kg), acepromazine (2.5 mg/kg), and 0.9% sodium chloride solution (1:1:2 by volume), and maintained with 2% isoflurane delivered through a vaporizer by oxygen into a nosepiece at 70 ml/min in group 1. Anesthesia was induced by 4% isoflurane and maintained by 2% isoflurane delivered by oxygen through a vaporizer into a nosepiece at 70 ml/min in group 2. MR studies of the tumors were performed on a 9.4T Bruker Biospec spectrometer with a home built surface coil. Dynamic magnetic resonance contrast images of the tumor were acquired before and after the injection of albumin-(DTPA-Gd) at 0.1 mmol gadolinium/kg with a strong T1-weighted 3D saturation recovery gradient echo sequence (20 ms recovery delay, 1.5 ms echo time, 90 flip angle, and 27 ms repetition time, FOV 12x12x10mm, matrix 128x64x50, number of average 6, acquisition time about 6 minutes). Post contrast images were acquired 1 minute after the injection of albumin-(DTPA-Gd) and repeated every 7 minutes from 1 to 29 minutes. Mouse body temperature was maintained with a 37C water pad placed under the coil during MRI studies.

From the point of view of ecocriticism, it unfolds from the hypothesis according to which concerns relating to degrowth and \"deconsumption\" emerge in Gionian narratives. By verifying this postulate which combines economic aspects, sociological factors and ecological questions, by calling to the rescue the theories of so-called happiness economists and those relating to ecosophy, the analysis reveals the mechanisms by which Giono imagines a society where the environment ceases to be brought into line, even if it means producing and consuming little but decently. For such a society, it is necessary to invent other criteria for measuring wealth. These new criteria give a clear place to the management and the conservation of nature promoted to a new order of (over) priority. As a result, they relegate the classic and ecocidal GDP (Gross Domestic Product) to the background to highlight the GDH ecophil (Gross Domestic Happiness).

The 70-year construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics has made remarkable achievements in economic development. Past economic theories are no longer able to explain China's unique economic development model, so it is urgent to accelerate the construction of the theoretical system of socialist political economy with Chinese characteristics to adapt to the socialist economic construction with Chinese characteristics in the new era. This paper holds that Marx's theory of political economy is critical and revolutionary, but Marx's political economy construction method is constructive. Using Marx's political economy construction method to build the new political economy system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should take China\u2019s national subjectivity as the logical starting point, take China standing up, getting rich and getting strong as the center, and take the status quo of world development as the basic background. On the basis of digging out new materials and discovering new problems in the practice of China\u2019s 70 years of development, we should take the characteristics and development path of the \u201cthree laws\u201d in China as the main part, deepen the theoretical analysis and logical academic construction of the \u201cChinese model\u201d of economic construction, refine a new theory of academic rationality, summarize new practices with regularity, embody Chinese characteristics, Chinese style, Chinese temperament, and embody inheritance and nationality, originality and time, systematic characteristic and specialization.", "doi": "10.30845/ijbss.v10n10a4", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "International Journal of Business and Social Science", "venue": "International Journal of Business and Social Science", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "The Invention of Robert Bresson: the Auteur and his market", "abstract": "Nailing its colours firmly to the auteurist mast, Colin Burnett\u2019s erudite, elegantly written study approaches Robert Bresson, characterized as an \u2018ambitious visionary\u2019 with a desire to \u2018revolutioni...", "doi": "10.1080/09639489.2020.1816941", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Modern & Contemporary France", "venue": "Modern & Contemporary France", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Malay Seals from the Islamic World of Southeast Asia: Content, Form, Context, Catalogue by Annabel Teh Gallop (review)", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Sojourn: Journal of Social Issues in Southeast Asia", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Le bleu du ciel", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Post-apartheid whiteness and unlearning racism", "abstract": "people\u2019s wedding songs are observantly introduced to us by Petrus Angula Mbenzi.

Neural stem cell (NSC) therapy offers replacement of damaged cells and delivery of pro-regenerative factors, but >95% of cells die when transplanted to sites of neural injury. Biomaterial scaffolds provide cellular protective encapsulation to improve cell survival. However, current available scaffolds are overwhelmingly not approved for human use, presenting a major barrier to clinical translation. Surgical biomaterials offer the unique benefit of being FDA-approved for human implantation. Specifically, a neurosurgical grade material, DuraGen\u2122, used predominantly for human duraplasty has many attractive features of an ideal biomaterial scaffold. Here, we have investigated the use of DuraGen\u2122 as a 3D cell encapsulation device for potential use in combinatorial, regenerative therapies. Methods Primary NSCs were seeded into optimised sheets of DuraGen\u2122. NSC growth and fate within DuraGen\u2122 were assessed using 3D microscopic fluorescence imaging techniques. Results DuraGen\u2122 supports the survival (ca 95% viability, 12 days) and 3D growth of NSCs. NSC phenotype, proliferative capacity and differentiation into astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes were unaffected by DuraGen\u2122.

Predictive models have been used in an attempt to modulate the morbidity and mortality of patient outcomes. We used machine learning (ML) to identify risk factors predictive of in-hospital mortality in the severe TBI patient population with aSDH.\n \n \n \n We included 74 patients with severe TBI and aSDH in the analysis. Random forest, ML architecture, was used to create a predictive model of in-hospital mortality with a pre-set precision of 97.4% (RStudio-3.5). A total of 133 input variables including demographics, in-hospital laboratory values, and outcome measures were included and mean accuracy ranks were assessed\n \n \n \n The highest scoring input variables were length of stay, last sodium value collected, last platelet value collected, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) motor exam score on day two. Mean length of stay was significantly shorter in the group of patients that died (4.114 \u00b1 4.241 d vs 22.72 \u00b1 11.72; P < .0001) The mean sodium that was last collected was significantly more elevated in the group of patients who died (139.9 \u00b1 3.299 vs 148.9 \u00b1 8.825 mEq/L; P < .0001).

Adequate monitoring of sodium and platelet levels, as well as the GCS motor examination, can promote goal-directed therapy.

Concerned cases of flight envelope include hover at maximum height, level flight at high velocity, pull-up manoeuvres applying cyclic pitch and mixed collective and cyclic control. The simulation calculations were executed for data of light helicopter with three-bladed articulated rotor. For analysis, the real blades are treated as elastic axes with distributed masses of blade segments. The model of deformable blade allows for out-of-plane bending, in plane bending, and torsion. For assumed flight state of helicopter, the equations of rotor blades motion are solved applying Runge-Kutta method. According to Galerkin method, for each concerned azimuthal position of blade the parameters of its motions are assumed as a combination of considered bending and torsion eigen modes of the blade. The loads of rotor blades generated during flight depend due to velocity of flight, helicopter mass, position of rotor axis in air and deflections of swashplate that correspond to collective and cyclic pitch angle applied to rotor blades. The results of simulations presenting rotor loads and blade deformations are shown in form of time-runs and as plots of rotor-disk distributions. The simulations of helicopter flight states may be useful for prediction the conditions of flight-tests without exceeding safety boundaries or may help to define limitations for manoeuvre and control of helicopter.", "doi": "10.2478/kones-2019-0042", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of KONES", "venue": "Journal of KONES Powertrain and Transport", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}], "physical chemistry": [{"title": "Otrzymywanie oraz charakterystyka uk\u0142ad\u00f3w dostarczania substancji leczniczej opartych na mezoporowatej krzemionce SBA-15 modyfikowanej polimerem", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.15199/62.2015.6.4", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Przemysl Chemiczny", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Synthesis, characterization and microbiological screening of some transition metal complexes with nitrogen containing macrocyclic ligand", "abstract": "A novel macrocyclic Schiff base ligand 1,4,8,11-tetraaza-2,3,9,10-tetramethyl cyclotetradeca-1,3,8,10-tetraene was synthesized by condensation between butane-2,3-dione and propane-1,3-diamine in an alcoholic medium.

Combined with field research, they can help to balance the internal and external validity of causal relationships. Studies have focused on only a limited range of topics, such as the early stages of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial decision-making at a micro level, with little attention been paid to the factors in the entrepreneurial process as well as the factors at an industrial or macro level. Moreover, previous reviews have mainly focused on the normative use of experimental methods in entrepreneurship research; few have discussed how to further integrate experimental methods into the research questions pertinent to entrepreneurship, let alone articulate how to use experimental methods to investigate the unique contexts and principles of entrepreneurship. To bridge this research gap, the study reviews 65 papers published in 14 authoritative journals in the disciplines of management and entrepreneurship. It identifies research trends, research topics, research paradigms, and experimental manipulations. Research topics include entrepreneurs/entrepreneurial teams, entrepreneurial opportunities, venture capital, entrepreneurial decision-making, entrepreneurial education and training, entrepreneurial failure, gender differences, and rural entrepreneurship. Two categories of the research paradigm are identified: entrepreneurship experiments \uff08which include scenario-based entrepreneurship experiments and the application of psychology and decision science experiments in entrepreneurship\uff09 and studies that combine multiple methods. Experimental manipulations include active participation, passive participation, active role-playing, and passive role-playing. Finally, we propose future research directions from three perspectives. First, we suggest extending the research contexts and research levels of experimental studies in entrepreneurship. Specifically, future research may: \uff081\uff09 extend to specific entrepreneurship contexts, such as family entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship; and focus on the whole process of entrepreneurship, including entrepreneurial activities in the growth, stabilization, decline, failure, and innovation stages; \uff082\uff09 apply experimental methods to advance indigenous entrepreneurship research; \uff083\uff09 extend the application of experimental methods in entrepreneurship research to team or firm level research. Second, future research may combine experimental methods with new technologies. Specifically, future research may: \uff081\uff09 combine experimental research with neuroscience and pay attention to the emerging field of neuro-entrepreneurship; \uff082\uff09 apply web-based technologies to entrepreneurship research.

One of these is usually assumed to have been the practice of receiving people whom the Roman state wanted to be confined in a secure environment, in other words, state prisoners. The ancient sources mention several cases of people, mostly of high rank, being sent to cities in Italy to be confined there. However, much remains uncertain about the regulations regarding these prisoners. In particular, it is not clear why they were sent to the places mentioned in the sources, and whether these towns were compelled to receive them; if refusal was indeed impossible, it is not clear on what legal or practical basis such duties could be imposed by Rome. Most towns mentioned as prison towns are Latin colonies, and it is sometimes assumed that this was a result of their privileged position.2 However, other scholars argue that, instead of a privilege, this was a duty which the Romans could impose on any town they wished. This duty is often connected to the ius exilii: Romans could go into exile in Latin and allied towns in Italy which possessed a reciprocal right of exile, which was laid down in a treaty; most towns are assumed to have had a treaty containing the ius exilii.3 However, as we shall see below, it is unlikely that this ius had anything to do with the choice of prison locations. I will argue that the Roman state could indeed burden some Latin colonies with guarding prisoners, but that not all Latin towns could be compelled to do so, and that their possibilities for refusing were determined by specific historical circumstances. The policy of the Roman state with regard to its prisoners will provide a clearer understanding of the developing relationship between Rome and its allies, especially in the second century B.C., and of the role of Latin and Italian towns in the government of the Roman state.", "doi": "10.1017/S0009838811000644", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "The Classical Quarterly", "venue": "Classical Quarterly", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Suicide in the Roman Republic", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Juno\u2019s \u201cAeneid\u201d: A Battle for Heroic Identity.

Weather events such as these inflict injury and, in some cases, death on park visitors as well as damage park infrastructure, amenities, and other natural resources. Park and recreation professionals, especially those in severe weather-prone areas, must prepare for and respond to such events with the appropriate emergency operations and hazard mitigation procedures (National Park Service, 2006; Whitworth & May, 2006). Following the tourism disaster and crisis management frameworks (Faulkner, 2001; Ritchie, 2008), this study focuses on risk analysis and hazard mitigation strategies and implementations applicable to parks and recreation areas. Additionally, this study seeks to remedy the lack of longitudinal historical research by employing geographic information system (GIS)-based approaches to investigate the spatial interaction between severe weather events and state parks. Using geospatial data of tornado, hail, wind, and lightning events from 1950 to 2015, provided by NOAA\u2019s National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center, we quantitatively evaluate the potential risk of severe weather on Oklahoma State Parks. GIS-based kernel density estimation was utilized to create interpolated raster surfaces representing accumulated risk (1950-2015) for each type of severe weather event (similar to Dixon et al., 2011). Results show that tornadoes had the most widespread impact on parks in central to north-central regions of Oklahoma. Conversely, the risk posed by hail is more prevalent in parks located in western Oklahoma while parks in northeastern Oklahoma are most affected by severe winds. Parks located in the southeastern corner of Oklahoma have higher chance of lightning strikes. By combining all types of severe weather as a composite dataset, a \u2018severe weather risk\u2019 score was assigned to each state park. Natural hazard mitigation strategies and recommendations include allocate operation and maintenance appropriation to severe weather-prone state parks, strengthen emergency response procedure and training programs, and raise natural hazard awareness through communication and education programs. Although this study emphasizes a state-level administration, these methods are transferable to other scales (i.e., national, local) depending on data availability.

Responsibility towards environment has become one of the most crucial areas of social responsibility. Recent years have observed rising concern for environmental degradation, which is taking place mainly in the form of soil erosion, deforestation and pollution of various types, including air, water, sound, etc. At the same time, there has been a growing awareness internationally on the disclosure and reporting of environmental performance, particularly from those firms that have a direct and substantial influence on the environment like manufacturing, power generation, mining, etc., to provide information regarding the environmental implications of their operations. There is a growing pressure on the corporate enterprises to consider environmental effects of their operation. As a result, accounting and disclosure of environmental matters have rapidly been emerging as an important dimension of environment management (Rao et al., 2012).Developing countries like India are facing the twin problem of protecting the environment and promoting economic development. A careful assessment of the benefits and costs of environmental damages is necessary to find the safe limits of environmental degradation and the required level of development. The Indian corporate sector has started realizing the need for adequate corporate environment and social disclosures in order to repose the confidence of the stakeholders in the working of their enterprises and performance.Consumers in recent times expect firms to meet high health and safety standards for workers, respect human rights, protect the interests of consumers and meet environmental standards regardless of where they operate (Smith et al., 2007). Therefore, it is expected that companies provide relevant information about their environmental performance and policies, together with management systems in operation to support them, commonly known as triple bottom line reporting. Environmental accounting is a process of identification of measurement and communication of information on the environmentally responsible activities for a business entity. Environmental reporting is commonly used for presenting environmentally-related data regarding environmental risks, environmental impacts and policies (Qureshi et al., 2012).Despite increasing awareness on environmental protection, there is very little reporting and disclosing practices adopted by companies. Managements seldom try to make proper arrangement to save the environment unless it is required as per law, as there is no direct relationship between investment and benefits (Anand and Srineevasa, 2014). This paper attempts to identify the current state of reporting and disclosure practices by sample companies in the southern part of the State of Rajasthan. The study considers Rajasthan because of its contribution to mining industries in India. Mining is one of the most environmentally hazardous industries. Rajasthan accounted for about 12% of the total number of mines in the country in 2012-13. The value of mineral production in Rajasthan during 2011-12 was 22,506.77 cr, which increased by 20.61% as compared to the previous year (Annual Report, 2012-13). The growth in industrialization is always attributed to the increase in environmental pollution particularly to that related to inland water, air and noise because sustainable development is not possible when environmental concerns are overlooked.Literature ReviewWith increasing emphasis on social and environmental concerns with respect to investment policies, the financial community is becoming increasingly interested in Environmental Reporting (Descano and Gentry, 1998). However, due to the voluntary nature of disclosures, this field is far from standardization (Monaghan, 1999). Denmark was the first country to introduce the requirement for public environmental reporting for companies, followed by Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands in 1996 (Scott and Brown, 2003). \u2026", "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of Management and Research", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "The Effect of Additions to Index on Stock Prices", "abstract": "This study examines the impact of inclusion of stocks in the stock indices on their market prices.

As IUPAC celebrates its centennial in 2019, its oldest body, the CIAAW, turns 120 with its beginnings tracing back to Berlin in 1899 [1]. Following its 2019 meeting, the CIAAW recommended changes to the standard atomic weight (i.e. relative atomic mass) of hafnium based on recent determinations and evaluations of its isotopic composition: hafnium: to 178.486 \u00b1 0.006 from 178.49 \u00b1 0.02 The CIAAW continues to recognize the extent of natural variations in the atomic weights of the elements. For example, radioactive decay of lutetium alters the isotopic composition of hafnium by producing the light isotope of hafnium-176. Thus, some rare terrestrial materials can have abnormal isotopic compositions of hafnium with the most extreme known case being sedimentary chert from South Africa having atomic-weight value of 178.447. The CIAAW continues to evaluate literature data which leads to identifi cation of developments in the measurement science, recognition of new discoveries, and remains committed to modernize its technical guidelines and work towards further expansion of its website to include more historical databases.

Using C elegans transgenics that express expanded polyQs in neurons, we identified a gene network that is centred onto FoxO and that protects neurons from expanded polyQs screen for genes that modulate the early phases of expanded polyQ neurotoxicity. Among these genes, we identified AMPK, a well known energy sensor involved in lifespan and health span extension in worms and mammals. Aims AMPK is amenable to be regulated by different drugs. Some of these drugs, like metformin, are approved for human use, hence AMPK may be of therapeutic interest in HD. Therefore, we sought to characterise AMPK in the context of neuronal vulnerability caused by expanded htt in different models. Methods First, we investigated the function of AMPK in C elegans and its potential interaction with well established neuroprotective genes by using mutants and drugs, such as metformin. We then validated our results in an in vitro model of HD: striatal cells from HdhQ111 knock-in mice, carrying the expanded (109Q) or wild-type (7Q) alleles of htt. Finally, we tested the potential of AMPK activation in mice, by overexpressing a gain of function allele of AMPK-\u03b3, which activates AMPK function. Results By doing epistatic analysis in worms, we show that AMPK is required for neuroprotection through the FOXO/daf-16 signalling pathway. The depletion of AMPK enhances neuronal impairment, and activation by metformin induces neuroprotection, suggesting that this enzyme may be of therapeutic interest in HD. Similar findings were obtained in striatal cells from HdhQ111. Finally, preliminary results suggest that activation of AMPK protects from the neuropathological effects of N terminal expanded htt in a lentivirius based model of HD in mice. Conclusion These results strongly suggest that AMPK is of therapeutic interest in HD and warrant further investigation of AMPK activity in HD neurons.", "doi": "10.1136/jnnp.2010.222570.9", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry", "venue": "Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery & Psychiatry", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy in ultra high risk states of psychosis (UHR)", "abstract": "Ultra-high risk of psychosis (UHR) is a condition associated with a higher risk of developing schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder as compared to the general population.

In the course of evolutionary discussion of chemical substance abuse, the issue was approached through five steps. The biological level helps to understand the interference and coevolution of chemical agents and biochemical mechanisms, thus demonstrating the vulnerability toward chemical agents. The psychological level approaches behavior and its change, taking into account the consequences of the substance-induced false feelings. The social, cultural and civilization levels take into account the effects of the non-physical environment by discussing the interactions among individuals, the benefits of communication and group formation, and the subsequently emerging conflicts. The integration at individual level is implemented by the Zinberg three-pillar model, while for the integration at the level of population the phenomenon of run-away is recommended in the literature. The paper disputes the latter and suggests the concept of civilization disease to describe the phenomenon. To explain the epidemic of chemical substance abuse in our age, two additional, interrelated reasons are listed: the change in the relation to time and spirituality. And also, the question whether the appearance of epigenetics in medical thinking means the renaissance of degenerationism is raised in the article. The author has finally arrived at the conclusion that the reasons for the increase of chemical substance use in the postmodern era are basically the consequences of the strengthened psycho-social mismatch such as the rate of environmental change, changes in social control, social insecurity and anxiety, and the secularization of drug use.

AIM: To review and meta-analyze the empirical literature on fantasy proneness (as indexed by the Creative Experiences Questionnaire) that appeared between 2000 and 2018. METHOD: We searched Google Scholar to identify relevant papers and subjected them to inspection. In doing so, we specifically looked at correlations between fantasy proneness, on the one hand, and dissociative symptoms, magical ideation, depression, anxiety, trauma, and susceptibility to false memories, on the other hand. Correlations were weighted using the Hunter-Schmidt approach. RESULTS: We identified 97 studies that together included 16.999 research participants. Fantasy proneness strongly correlated with both dissociative symptoms and magical ideation. The association of fantasy proneness with depression and anomalistic was moderate. Its association with trauma and anxiety was small, albeit significant, and much the same was true for false memories. CONCLUSION: The psychopathological relevance of fantasy proneness is broader than just dissociative symptoms. The modest correlation between trauma and fantasy proneness suggests that, apart from trauma, other causal antecedents of fantasy proneness exist.

Thorez was viscerally attached to the Soviet Union, and would spend many years there, notably after deserting from the army in 1939, then after suffering a stroke in 1950. At no moment did he publicly criticize the homeland of Bolshevism and purged those who dared. But Bulaitis is right to illustrate the Frenchness of this son of a miner from Pas de Calais. Thorez had a passion for French history, culture, countryside and cuisine, and seems to have been happiest during the Popular Front and the coalition government of 1945\u20131947, when a \u2018national communism\u2019 promised to become a concrete reality. Thorez\u2019s sometimes embarrassing cult of the personality was a smaller version of Stalin\u2019s, but Bulaitis places it in a French tradition that includes the Sun King, Napoleon, Petain and de Gaulle. Indeed, French communists\u2019 cult of leadership and notorious dogmatism may carry the traces of their country\u2019s Catholic past. One little-known aspect of Thorez which emerges from this biography is his boyhood Catholic fervour, which, in his last years, finds echoes in his sympathetic response to Vatican II. Thorez seems to have been haunted by the past: an unhappy childhood, grinding poverty and pit explosions, and the trauma of the German invasion of 1914. From this came an attachment to family life and a precocious awareness of mortality. He was also haunted by the accusation of having deserted France \u2013 and, with it, the Resistance \u2013 in 1939. This explains his long-running feud with communists with much more heroic pasts, such as Andr e Marty and Charles Tillon, whom he would have liquidated, in a non-fateful manner, in Stalin\u2019s last year. At times, Thorez was excellent at what he called \u2018doing politics\u2019. At other times, he was blinded to the realities of real existing socialism and the post-war prosperity of les trente glorieuses. But, again, Bulaitis shows convincingly that it would be reductive to portray Thorez as a Stalinist apparatchik: in his final years, he laid the basis for a \u2018common programme\u2019 in an electoral alliance with Mitterrand\u2019s rejuvenated Socialists.

The received view on this issue is epitomized by the traditional tenet that logical inference is \u2018tautological\u2019 (literally, repetitive and trivially true), namely that a valid inference is one in which the information carried by the conclusion is (in a sense variously specified) contained in the information carried by the (conjunction of the) premises. At the mid of the 20th century, Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s controversial theory of \u2018semantic information\u2019 provided what is, to date, the strongest theoretical justification for this tenet. However, as remarked by a number of authors who have made the history of logic, including Frege, Dummett and Hintikka, the received view clashes with the intuitive idea that deductive arguments are useful just because, by their means, we obtain information that we did not possess before. Moreover, it also clashes with two 20th-century milestones of the theory of computation: the undecidability of first-order logic and the NP-hardness of propositional logic. How can logic be informationally trivial and, yet, computationally hard? Can we obtain an informational characterization of logical consequence that is more in tune with our intuition and with the negative results on the computational complexity of logical reasoning? Besides and beyond this well-known and puzzling difficulty\u2014which has recently seen a revival of attention both for its philosophical and for its computational aspects\u2014a deep interest in an informational view of logic has been pivotal in research on non-classical logics at least since Kripke and Urquhart provided informational semantics for intuitionistic logic (Kripke, 1965) and relevant logics (Urquhart, 1972). It has been pursued by authors such as Barwise and Perry, Ono and Komori, Girard, Van Benthem, Wansing and many others. Furthermore, the connection between logic and information has been the subject of extensive research in epistemic logics. From this point of view, logic allows for a clarification of the nature of different kinds of information and for deeper investigations into their formal properties. Over the last few years, a fresh view of these fundamental issues has been put forward by the development of philosophy of information as a specific, interdisciplinary and fast-expanding area of research. This new subject is rapidly attracting a large community of researchers from a variety of disciplines and is leading to a growing number of conferences and workshops all over the world. However, there is still no dedicated venue that focuses explicitly and uniquely on its contributions to the field of logic and computation.

Methods: The experimental method was used. Twelve healthy adult New Zealand long-eared rabbits were divided into normal control group and scar group, with 6 rabbits in each group. The hypertrophic scar model of long-eared rabbit was made according to the literature, and the rats in normal control group were subjected to no disposal. At 60 days after modeling, hematoxylin eosin(HE) staining was used to detect the morphology of skin tissue cells in the two groups. The mRNA expressions of miR-296 and transforming growth factor-\u03b21(TGF-\u03b21) were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Human fibroblasts (HFbs) were divided into psiCHECK-WT-TGF-\u03b21+miR-296 negative control group, psiCHECK-WT-TGF-\u03b21+miR-296 mimic group, psiCHECK-MUT-TGF-\u03b21+miR-296 negative control group, and psiCHECK-MUT-TGF-\u03b21+miR-296 mimic group. And the corresponding sequence were transfected respectively. At 48 h after transfection, luciferase reporter gene detection kit was used to detect the luciferase and renal luciferase expression of miR-296 and TGF-\u03b21 in each group, and the ratio was used to reflect the gene expression level. Two batches of HFbs were used and divided into miR-296 negative control group and miR-296 mimic group, transfecting the corresponding sequence. The first batch of cells were used. At 0 (immediately), 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after transfection, the cell proliferation was detected by thiazolyl blue method. The second batch of cells were used. At 24 h after transfection, the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and collagen type I was detected by Western blotting. The number of samples in cell experiment was 3. Data were statistically analyzed with analysis of variance factorial design, one-way analysis of variance, independent-samples t test, LSD-t test and Pearson correlation coefficient regression. Results: At 60 days after modeling, Fbs in scar group were hyperplastic and arranged abnormally; Fbs in normal control group were evenly arranged without morphological abnormality.

Major themes have included the Wagner school, the Secessionist movement, the Wiener Werkstatte, and the rejection or remaking of ornament and symbol. By contrast, Christopher Long's The New Space: Movement and Experience in Viennese Modern Architecture offers a fresh perspective by looking closely into spatial experiments within Viennese modernism from around 1910, with the waning of the Jugendstil, until 1938, when Hitler and the Nazis annexed Austria. Long traces the evolving ideas about space articulated in the writings and buildings of three Viennese architects\u2014Oskar Strnad, Adolf Loos, and Josef Frank\u2014and highlights their shared investments in conceiving spaces that might elicit perceptual sensitivity. Pursing this line, The New Space opens a new and significant chapter in the history of modernist space making.\n\nOf the book's three protagonists, Loos has received the most extensive scholarly interest, especially for his rejection of modern ornament and his Raumplan concept. By contrast, Frank has remained a relatively peripheral figure, despite growing attention to his distinctive approach to architectural space.1 Strnad is the least known. Aside from a few early monographs and a recent exhibition catalogue published in German, The New Space is the first major publication in English to examine his work in depth.2\n\nIn the course of ten chapters, Long weaves the three architects' individual experiments into an account of a shared quest to create affective spatial experience. Chapter 1 summarizes key debates about architectural space in contemporary German-speaking intellectual circles and lays the theoretical groundwork for the three architects' practice. Art historian August Schmarsow is a central figure in this discussion, given his influential assertion that the essence of architectural creation is the framing of space; everything else (facade, structure, mass, and ornament) is secondary, \u2026", "doi": "10.1525/JSAH.2018.77.3.353", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians", "venue": "Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians (JSAH)", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Diving Deep into Unknown Unknowns: People, Cities, Technology Architecture and Architects", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1002/ad.2567", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Architectural Design", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Review: The New Farm: Contemporary Rural Architecture", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1525/jsah.2021.80.2.240", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians", "venue": "Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians (JSAH)", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Psychiatric Center Caritas", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1080/10464883.2019.1560807", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Journal of Architectural Education", "venue": "Journal of Architectural Education", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "From Altars to Alterity: Offerings and Inheritances for Queer Vietnamese Kin", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1002/ad.2879", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Architectural Design", "venue": "Architectural Design", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "The Museum is the Exhibit", "abstract": "Frank Lloyd Wright's bold spiralling building on Fifth Avenue in New York City is still, 50 years after it opened, the Guggenheim's most popular attraction.

Resolved anomalies include ice buoyancy, ice slipperiness, water skin toughness, supercooling and superheating at the nanoscale, etc. Evidence shows consistently that molecular undercoordination shortens the H\u2013O bond and stiffens its phonon while undercoordination does the O:H nonbond contrastingly associated with strong lone pair \u201c:\u201d polarization, which endows the low-dimensional water ice with supersolidity. The supersolid phase is hydrophobic, less dense, viscoelastic, thermally more diffusive, and stable, having longer electron and phonon lifetime. The equal number of lone pairs and protons reserves the configuration and orientation of the coupled O:H\u2013O bonds and restricts molecular rotation and proton hopping, which entitles water the simplest, ordered, tetrahedrally-coordinated, fluctuating molecular crystal covered with a supersolid skin.

The YOUSAT project proposes that to address this issue and to help the industry develop new destinations, tourism-related players should become more active within the new social media spaces, user-generated content, in combination with new mobile location-based services. Starting with theories around map-based mobile services with multiple information layers where users can create and share travel stories in groups, this two-year project has engaged users and tourist organisations in order to come up with service design recommendations. This has resultet in a feature set then implemented as a prototype service on top of the mobile maptechnology from one of the industry partners. In developing new interactive content the project has also tackled difficult issues such as solutions for lack of network coverage in these potentially remote areas. Furthermore, different business models have been evaluated within the project, and will hopefully be carried on with the continued work on the prototype service.

By capturing various perceptions a student might have with respect to a computer-based task\u2019s quality characteristics, the scale measures a students\u2019 overall impressions regarding the task at hand while providing a means for understanding what quality characteristics constitute the impressions students form. In addition, exploratory factor analysis revealed three underlying dimensions of the Impressions of the Task construct: Social Experience, Caliber, and Demands on the Learner.\nTo address the second major goal of this research, the effects of two vehicles of first impression formation\u2014each representing a different channel leading to the first impression effect\u2014were investigated: (1) the aesthetic elements of computer interface design and (2) verbal (i.e., in the form of words, written or spoken) information pertaining to the educational quality of the task.

Detection of endospores is vital in areas ranging from bioburden reduction to homeland security. Rapid bacterial spore detection is achieved by targeting dipicolinic acid (DPA), a chemical marker unique to endospores. An improvement on the current bacterial spore detection assay based on sensitized lanthanide luminescence is presented through the implementation of a dipicolinate-specific Tb^(3+) receptor site. The use of a chelating ligand such as DO2A (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,7-bisacetate) can increase both the sensitivity and selectivity of the assay. The luminescent series of Ln(DO2A)(DPA)- complexes (Ln = Sm, Eu, Tb and Dy) is fully characterized in terms of structure, photophysics and stability, and the Tb(DO2A)^+ binary complex in particular is investigated as a sensing complex for bacterial spores. The \u2018ligand enhancement\u2019 observed in all cases improves dipicolinate binding affinity by approximately one order of magnitude over the lanthanide ion alone. Binding of the DO2A ligand also appears to generate a \u2018gadolinium break\u2019 effect, creating a discrepancy in binding affinity in the lanthanide series and rendering the terbium complex the most effective dipicolinate receptor site of all investigated. We have also extended the application of this receptor site design technology to the targeted detection of other aromatic analytes of biological relevance, such as salicylates and catecholamines. Our work indicates that construction of effective receptor site complexes is not governed by net electrostatic considerations, and that local charge variations from the ligand-induced perturbation of lanthanide electron density may play a significant role. This work sets the stage for the development of the next-generation terbium(macrocycle) complex for bacterial spore detection, with the aim of constructing a solid-state endospore microsensor for applications ranging from sterilization validation to life detection in extreme environments.", "doi": "10.7907/0NFE-Y329.", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Determina\u00e7\u00e3o dos is\u00f3topos naturais de R\u00e1dio de meias-vidas longas, 226Ra e 228Ra, em \u00e1guas minerais utilizadas nos balne\u00e1rios de Caxamb\u00fa (MG) e \u00c1guas de Lind\u00f3ia (SP)", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.11606/D.85.2012.TDE-03042012-083738", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Field of View Measurements on a Collimated Transportable HPGe System Used in Search Systems", "abstract": "Mobile search systems are used to locate and identify radioactive material as the system is transported along a path. Both low and high resolution detectors are used in these systems. Low resolution detectors are often overwhelmed by high NORM background to the extent that the source signal is hidden. High resolution germanium detectors are more selective with easily identifiable peaks and the sensitivity can be improved further with background reduction. The detection efficiency is peaked in the forward direction, but to achieve the highest sensitivity possible the gamma ray flux from other directions must be reduced. In some circumstances the interfering radioactive background flux may be much higher than the flux from the source of interest. For example: a shipping container full of NORM may be used in an attempt to mask the presence of a concealed SNM source. It is therefore often desirable to examine only one area, object or container at a time to localize a source in a search operation. To do this, it is helpful to restrict the field of view of the instrument by shielding. For a mobile system, the shielding must be as small as possible to reduce the total weight of the system. The performance of a large diameter HPGe detector in a mobile housing was measured for all angles and for multiple energies to determine its effectiveness in reducing the count rate from material outside the desired field of view.

While smoking is associated with inferior outcome in NSCLC patients, smoking also correlates with a higher tumor mutational burden. In contrast to adenocarcinomas (ADC) of non-smokers, that frequently harbor targetable gain-of-function mutations, NSCLC smokers largely present with non-targetable loss-of-function mutations of genes associated with DNA-damage repair. The transcription factor Pit-1, Oct1/2, Unc-86 (POU) domain class 2 transcription factor 1 (POU2F1) is a widely expressed bipotential stabilizer of repressed and inducible transcriptional states and frequently deregulated in cancer. Methods Via immunohistochemistry, we evaluated POU2F1 protein expression on a tissue micro array of 217 operable stage I\u2013III NSCLC patients. Findings were reproduced in a gene expression database of 1144 NSCLC patients, filtered for POU2F1 mRNA expression. After retroviral overexpression of POU2F1 in A549 cells, we evaluated for clonogenic growth and proliferation. Additionally, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated POU2F1 knockdown in A549 cells was likewise analyzed. Results High protein expression of POU2F1 in 217 NSCLC patients resulted in improved outcome of smokers with ADC [hazard ratio (HR) 0.30 (0.09\u20130.99), P=0.035]. Moreover, gene expression analysis confirmed favorable outcome of high POU2F1 mRNA expression in smokers with ADC [HR 0.41 (0.24\u20130.69), P<0.001]. Other than that, retrovirally induced overexpression of POU2F1 in A549 cells significantly reduced both, clonogenic growth as well as proliferation of NSCLC cells, whereas CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockdown of the protein did not have any impact. Conclusions Our data suggest that high expression of POU2F1 mediates a less aggressive cancer phenotype in smokers with ADC NSCLC. Pharmacological induction of genes and signaling pathways controlled by POU2F1 may provide novel avenues for future targeted NSCLC therapies in smokers.", "doi": "10.21037/tlcr-22-714", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Translational Lung Cancer Research", "venue": "Translational Lung Cancer Research", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Dose reduction in 18F-FDG high-resolution dedicated breast PET", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "The Journal of Nuclear Medicine", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "Correlation between Helicobacter pylori infection and local infiltration of gastric cancer", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.11569/WCJD.V18.I3.268", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "World Chinese Journal of Digestology", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "CLL-358: First-Line Treatment of Hairy Cell Leukemia with Cladribine Followed by Rituximab Consolidation Significantly Improves Leukemia-Free Survival", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/s2152-2650(20)30803-x", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma & Leukemia", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "Diagnostic performance of bone SPECT/CT for traumatic injuries of ankle and foot in comparison with MRI", "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "The Journal of Nuclear Medicine", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "2.41 Clinical Significance of Sex Chromosome Loss in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/J.CLML.2011.09.074", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma & Leukemia", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "AML-405: T-Cell Dynamics Associated with Outcomes in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Before and After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/s2152-2650(20)30777-1", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma & Leukemia", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "IBCL-176: Single-Centre Experience with Stem-Cell Transplantation in Patients with Transformed Lymphoma: A Potential Curative Option", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/s2152-2650(20)30899-5", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma & Leukemia", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}], "bioinformatics": [{"title": "HYBRID TEXTURE IDENTIFICATION METHOD", "abstract": "The importance of the modeling mode in systems of computer visual pattern recognition is shown.

Texture identification methods, such as, statistical, spectral, expert, multifractal, which are used to identify and analyze texture images, have been analyzed. To determine texture regions on images that are of a combined spectral-statistical nature, a hybrid texture identification method has been developed which makes it possible to take into account the local characteristics of the texture based on multifractal indicators characterizing the non-stationarity and impulsite of the data and the sign of the spectral texture. The stages of the developed hybrid texture identification method are: preprocessing; formation of the primary features vector; formation of the secondary features vector. The formation of the primary features vector is performed for the selected rectangular fragment of the image, in which the multifractal features and the spectral texture feature are calculated. To reduce the feature space at the stage of formation of the secondary identification vector, the principal component method was used. An experimental study of the developed hybrid texture identification method textures on model images of spectral, statistical, spectralstatistical textures has been carried out. The results of the study showed that the developed method made it possible to increase the probability of correct determination of the region of the combined spectral-statistical texture.

These episodes require treatment with a von Willebrand factor (VWF) containing concentrate; at present the only available concentrates are plasma derived. UK guidelines recommend using concentrates manufactured to the highest standards to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission.\n\nMethods Wilate\u00ae (Octapharma AG, Switzerland) is a dual virally inactivated FVIII/VWF concentrate available in the UK since 2007. Use of Wilate\u00ae between 2007 and 2012, including a period of product switching was evaluated in two large haemophilia centres (adult and paediatric). The primary study end-point was efficacy of concentrate usage for the treatment of bleeding and surgery. Efficacy was graded using 4 point ordinal scales that rated efficacy as; excellent, good, moderate or nil. Secondary end points were the occurrence of adverse events (immune, infective or thrombotic) and evidence of response on laboratory parameters.\n\nResults Between 01/03/07 and 01/05/12 a total of 4,565,450IU of Wilate\u00ae were used with data evaluable for 4,125,800IU (90.4%). Eighty two patients (44 male, 38 female) including 33 children (< 18yrs) and 49 adults (\u226518yrs) with type 1 (n=29), type 2 (n=34), type 3 diseases (n=16) and acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) (n=3) were treated. The median age at first treatment was 22.7 yrs (range 0.01- 82.3). The mean recoveries \u00b1 SD, following first dose in adults (n=35) were FVIII:C 2.25 \u00b1 0.65; VWF:Ag 2.4 \u00b1 0.70 and VWF:RCo 1.91 \u00b1 0.53.\n\nFifty three patients (20 < 18yr, 33 \u2265 18yr) received concentrate for 93 surgical interventions (36 major, 36 minor, 21 dental procedures). This included 22 patients with type 1, 22 type 2, 7 type 3 disease and 2 with AVWS. The median loading dose prior to surgery was 2700IU (range 450-7200) corresponding to 43.1IU/kg (range 11.84-125). Surgical procedures were covered with a median of 1 treatment (range 1-13) over a median of 1 day (range 1 \u2013 12). Thirty surgical episodes required \u22652 doses (27 major, 3 minor) with a median second dose of 1800IU (range 450-4500) corresponding to 36.4IU/kg (range 17.9-78.6). Overall efficacy was rated as excellent in 89.2% (n=83), good in 5.4% (n=5), moderate in 4.3% (n=4) and nil in 1.1% (n=1).\n\nThirty five patients (13 < 18yr, 22 \u2265 18yr) were treated for 80 non-surgical episodes of bleeding or trauma (37 major, 43 minor). This included 10 patients with type 1, 14 type 2, 10 type 3 disease and 1 with AVWS. The median first dose given was 2475 IU (range 250-7200) corresponding to 45.7 IU/kg (range 11.8- 97.8). Bleeding episodes were treated with a median of 2 treatments (range 1-80) over a median of 2 treatment days (range 1-78). Forty-three episodes required \u22652 doses (36 major, 7 minor) with a median follow-up dose of 2700IU (range 250-8100) corresponding to 39.3IU/kg (range 11.8-95.7). Overall efficacy was rated as being excellent in 87.5% (n=70), good in 10.0% (n=8), moderate in 2.5% (n=2) and nil in 0.0% (n=0).\n\nNine patients (1 < 18yr, 8 \u2265 18yr) were on home treatment regimens using 2,644,200 IU of Wilate\u00ae (64.1% total usage). These patients were treated using either on-demand (n=3), regular prophylaxis (n=5) or targeted prophylaxis (n=1). Two patients on prophylaxis switched to Wilate\u00ae within the study period with similar efficacy to the previous six months of treatment. Twelve patients were treated for other indications not covered by these categories. Wilate\u00ae was used to cover 3 un-complicated deliveries (1 operative and 2 vaginal deliveries).\n\nThere were 8 reported adverse events (8 patients), with 4 requiring medical review although not requiring in-patient treatment. One patient had treatment failure (impaired VWF:Ag recovery) on one treatment episode, and has been successfully re-treated. Five patients were re-challenged with only one having a repeat mild reaction. Five patients switched to an alternative product at the discretion of the patient/physician. No accumulation of FVIII was seen in patients treated for \u22653 days (mean change in FVIII:C trough level (first to last) +31.89iu/dl (-124.4 - +116.6)). No thrombosis, TTI or inhibitory antibodies were reported.\n\nConclusion Wilate\u00ae was efficacious (excellent or good efficacy in > 94%), safe and well tolerated in this heterogeneous group of 82 patients with VWD. Bleed resolution or prevention was 100% with no accumulation of FVIII seen.\n\nDisclosures: Batty: Octapharma: Research Funding, Travel and conference registration fees Other.

In recent years strain imaging has been emerging as a promising method for evaluation of left atrium (LA) function, being correlated with LV systolic dysfunction.\n \n \n \n We sought to evaluate LA mechanics in a cohort of patients with ischemic heart failure (HF) at one month after ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\n \n \n \n 40 patients were enrolled in this study: 30 consecutive patients with ischemic HF after STEMI, with LVEF\u2009<\u200950% and 10 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. All patients had standard echocardiographic examination; also LA strain curves were obtained using speckle tracking with measurement of peak LA systolic strain. Categorization of diastolic dysfunction severity into 3 grades was realized according to 2016 guidelines.\n \n \n \n 2D and 3D LVEF (33% vs 55%, p\u2009=\u20090.00), LV global strain (-10 vs -19, p\u2009=\u20090.00) and peak LA systolic strain (16 vs 33, p\u2009=\u20090.00) were significantly reduced in HF patients compared to controls. In both groups LA strain correlated with the following parameters: 2D EF (p\u2009=\u20090.024), 3D EF (p\u2009=\u20090.02), LV global strain (p\u2009=\u20090.00), E/A (p\u2009=\u20090.05), septal e\u2019 (p\u2009=\u20090.00), lateral e\u2019 (p\u2009=\u20090.00), E/septal e\u2019 (p\u2009=\u20090.006), E/lateral e\u2019 (p\u2009=\u20090.003), E/mean e\u2019 (p\u2009=\u20090.014), LA volume (p\u2009=\u20090.014) and LV filling pressures (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Peak LA systolic strain (PALS) values progressively decreased with worsening of diastolic function showing significant differences between all diastolic dysfunction grades. Using ROC analysis we identified 3 PALS thresholds to distinguish between normal diastolic function and the 3 diastolic dysfunction grades. The optimal cut off values were as follows: between normal diastolic function and grades 1-3 with PALS cut off value of 26.5 (Sb 90%, Sp 87%), AUC 0.963, CI 95%, p\u2009=\u20090.00; between grades 0-1 and grades 2-3 with peak LA strain cut off value of 17.2 (Sb 75%, Sp 93%) AUC\u2009=\u20090.828, CI 95%, p\u2009=\u20090.002; between grade 0-2 and grade 3 with peak LA strain cut off value of 11 (Sb 85%, Sp 93%), AUC 0.942, CI 95%, p\u2009=\u20090.00.\n Also, PALS value differed significantly between patients with normal vs high LV filling pressures. Using ROC analysis we determined a cut off value for LA of 15.1 to differentiate between the two subgroups with excellent discrimination power AUC 0.902, CI 95%, p\u2009=\u20090.00, Sb 88.9%, Sp 83% thus making LA strain an accurate surrogate estimate of LV filling pressures.\n \n \n \n Global peak LA systolic strain is significantly correlated with LV systolic and diastolic function. PALS is a feasible option for detection and categorization of diastolic dysfunction in patients with HF and depressed LVEF after STEMI. Incorporating LA strain into noninvasive assessment of LV diastolic dysfunction may improve the detection of elevated LV filling pressures. Further large scale studies are needed to validate this data.\n", "doi": "10.1093/ehjci/jez319.566", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "European Journal of Echocardiography", "venue": "", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": null, "abstract": null, "doi": null, "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": null, "venue": null, "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "ECG de abril de 2020", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.recesp.2019.10.007", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Revista Espanola De Cardiologia", "venue": "", "related": "No", "not_related": "Yes"}, {"title": "An aberrant patent ductus arteriosus mimicking aortopulmonary window.", "abstract": null, "doi": "10.5543/tkda.2019.02335", "score_for_L3": 1.0, "journal_name": "Turk Kardiyoloji Dernegi arsivi : Turk Kardiyoloji Derneginin yayin organidir", "venue": "Turk Kardiyoloji Dernegi arsivi : Turk Kardiyoloji Derneginin yayin organidir", "related": "Yes", "not_related": "No"}, {"title": "P847 Echocardiographic imaging in primary cardiac tumour-leiomyosarcoma", "abstract": "\n \n \n N.A\n Primary cardiac tumours are rare entities with an incidence rate of 0.0017% to 0.019% of which 25% are malignant.

Primary cardiac sarcomas typically present late with either quite advanced local cardiac symptoms or non-specific symptoms arising from metastasis (2). We herein report a rare presentation of leiomyosarcoma in a sixty-seven year old female Caucasian female, originally suspected following transthoracic echocardiogram.\n A large mass filling the Left Atrium(L.A) with a degree obstruction to the Mitral Valve (M.V) was firstly noted on transthoracic echocardiogram. This mass had a broad base, appeared to be originating from the pulmonary veins and was not encapsulated. A small circumferential pericardial effusion was noted. Overall biventricular function was preserved and there was no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed for staging which in addition to known cardiac mass revealed widespread bony metastases. A core biopsy of one of the lumbar paravertebral metastatic deposit was carried out to establish the diagnosis.\n We hope to add to the pool of increasing overall understanding of primary cardiac sarcomas and share our fascinating echocardiogram findings.

The need for metadata is commonly accepted, but it is not as commonly accepted that metadata need to be preserved to the same extent as files.

This is probably one of the reasons why there exist numerous examples of metadata being under backup only and not under bit preservation. Preservation of metadata is not just needed for future access of the objects, but also for re-establishment of repository systems after major breakdowns \u2013 or for establishment of a new repository as part of an exit strategy from a previous system.

However, the covalently crosslinked nature of these existing materials makes them difficult to degrade or recycle, leading to a waste of raw materials and aggravating environmental pollution. Here, we report a class of pH-responsive and recyclable hydrogels with versatile gas-releasing and scavenging properties, utilizing pH changes to reversibly control disassembly and reassembly of the hydrogel network. The initial hydrogels are constructed by a one-pot radical polymerization and contain dynamic molecular networks based on hydrophobic interactions, which can disassemble when the materials are placed in low pH solutions. The disassembled copolymer chains can reform hydrogels, following supplementation with fresh mineral salts and micelle monomers in neutral solutions. Moreover, the mineral salts used to reform hydrogels can function as gas donors or gas scavengers, endowing these hydrogels with versatile gas-releasing and consuming properties. Overall, this research provides a facile and environmentally friendly method to recycle hydrogels with gas-releasing and gas-scavenging properties, which have potential applications in diverse fields, including wound healing, wastewater management, and gas therapy for diseases.

The surfaces of both Ag/Ti and Au/Ti films exhibit a completely separated island structure, subsequently leading to the formation of a nanodot array after annealing. Based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis, we conclude that the dewetting progression speed of Ag/Ti films is higher than that of Au/Ti films.
