# scinobo-fos-taxonomy
The taxonomy has 6 Levels (L1-L6). The levels from L1-L3 are static and stem from the OECD and ScienceMetrix taxonomy. The rest of the levels are algorithmically constructed utilizing publication-to-publications and venue-to-venue citation graph as well as clustering and topic modelling algorithms.
